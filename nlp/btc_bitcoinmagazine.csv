2025-08-30,Google’s Android Lockdown: Are You Really In Control Of Your Phone? - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOMGRCNjhfb291NTVpZUtwdnBsdk5OSkl6dl9Fc0hzbHN2eW5tc0lReHhKenVqa3RsekdDLTNmRVB1WnBZanVpWlBPTU5CbC1JT0x2Z3MzOXF3b1lMUVhrSmV2T1RnTmIzbG9hanlkZEFSbjNPckktbGhoZ2pvOVo2endtTlhHWEZrcDVEVFhCVVZFV0RtSXVFQWloLXBfN3ZGZFA4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Android, Google’s mobile operating system, announced on August 25 that it will be requiring all app developers to verify their identity with the organization before their apps can run on “certified android devices.”

While this might sound like a common-sense policy by Google, this new standard is not just going to be applied to apps downloaded from Google Play store, but all apps, even those “side-loaded” — installed directly into devices by side-stepping the Google Play store. Apps of the sort can be found online in Github repositories or on project websites and installed on Android devices directly by downloading the installation files (known as APKs). 

What this means is that, if there is an application that Google does not like, be it because it does not conform to its policies, politics or economic incentives, they can simply keep you from running that application on your own device. They are locking down Android devices from running applications not with their purview. The ask? All developers, whether submitting their apps through the Play store or not, need to give their personal information to Google. 

The decision begs the question, if you can not run whatever app you want on your device without the permission of Google, then is it really your device? How would you respond if Windows decided you could only install programs from the Microsoft app store?

The move has of course made news in tech and cybersecurity media and caused quite a stir as it has profound consequences for the free and open web. For years, Android has been touted as an open source operating system, and through this strategy has gained massive distribution throughout the world with users in developing countries where Apple’s “walled garden” model and luxury devices are not affordable.

This new policy will tighten up controls over applications and its developers, and threatens the freedom to run whatever software you like on your own device in a very subversive and legalistic way. Because of Google’s influence over the Android variety of phones, the consequences of this policy are likely to be felt by the majority of users and devices, throughout the world.

Android justifies the policy change with concerns about the cybersecurity of their users. Malicious apps side-loaded into devices have led to “over 50 times more malware,” Android claims in their announcement blog. As a measure of “accountability,” and with the council of various governments throughout the world, Android has decided to take a “balanced approach,” and the language couldn’t be more Orwellian. 

“Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety” – Benjamin Franklin


Put in simpler terms, Google is looking to collect the personal information of software developers, centralizing it in its data centers alongside that of all of its users, in order to “protect” users from hackers that Google can’t seem to stop today in the first place.

After all, if Google and Android could actually keep personal user data secure in the first place, this would not be a problem, right?

Google’s solution to user data leaks is to collect more user data, ironically enough, in this case the data of developers who use the Android platform. A remarkable leap of logic, lazy and fundamentally decadent, a sign that they’ve lost their edge and arguably truly forgotten their now scrubbed “don’t be evil” motto.

Information Wants To Be Free
The reality is that Google finds itself trapped by a dilemma set up by the nature of information and the digital age, to quote the 90s cypherpunk Steward Brand, “information almost wants to be free.”

Every hop that personal data — like your name, face, home address or social security number — makes throughout the internet is an opportunity for it to get copied and leaked. As your information moves from your phone, to a server in your city to another server in a Google datacenter, every hop increases the likelihood that your data gets hacked and ends up on the dark web for sale. A thorny problem when user data is the primary business model of a giant like Google who processes it and sells it to advertisers who, in turn, create targeted ads. 

We can measure the truth of Brand’s information principle by looking at two fascinating statistics, which not too many people seem to talk about, oddly enough. The first is the absurd amount of data hacks that have taken place in the last 20 years. For example, the Equifax Data Breach in 2017 affected 147 million Americans, and the National Public Data Breach of 2024 affected over 200 million Americans, leading to leaked data that included social security numbers, likely ending up for sale on the dark web.

While legendary hacks like that of the Office of Personal Management of the U.S. government, compromised a large number of the U.S. Government officials at the time, including everything from social security numbers to medical records.

It’s not an exaggeration to say that a majority of Americans have had their data hacked and leaked already, and there’s no easy way to reverse that. How does one change their face, medical history or social security number after all?


The second statistic, which no one seems to connect to the first, is the rise of identity theft and fraud in the United States. Did you know that in 2012, 24 billion dollars’ worth of identity theft were reported? Twice as much as all other forms of theft combined that same year. Business Insider reported at the time from Bureau of Justice statistics that “identity theft cost Americans $24.7 billion in 2012, losses for household burglary, motor vehicle theft, and property theft totaled just $14 billion.” Eight years later that number doubled, costing Americans $56 billion in losses in 2020. Both of these trends continue to grow to this day. It may indeed already be too late for the old identity system, which we still rely so heavily on. 

Generative AI adds fuel to the fire, in some cases trained on leaked user data with examples of image models able to create high-quality images of humans holding fake IDs. As AI continues to improve, it is increasingly capable of fooling humans into thinking they are talking to another human as well, rather than a robot, creating new attack vectors for identity fraud and theft.

Nevertheless, Google insists that if we just collect a bit more personal user data, maybe then the problem will just go away. Convenient for a corporation whose main business model is the collection and sale of such data. Has any other corporation done more damage to civilian privacy than Google, by the way? (Facebook, I suppose.) 

In Cryptography We Trust
To be fair to the 2000s Web2 tech giants, the problem of secure identity in the digital age is not easy to solve. The legal structures of our societies around identity were created long before the internet emerged and moved all that data to the cloud. The only real solution to this problem now is actually cryptography, and its application to the trust that humans build in their relationships in the real world, over time.

The 90s cypherpunks understood this, which is why they invented two important technologies, PGP and webs of trust. 

PGP
PGP invented in 1991 by Phil Zimmermann, pioneered the use of asymmetric cryptography to solve this fundamental problem of protecting user data privacy while also enabling secure user authentication, identification and secure communication.

How? It’s simple, actually, by using cryptography in a similar way as Bitcoin does today to secure over a trillion dollars of value. You have a secure “password” and keep it as secret as possible, you don’t share it with anybody, and your apps use it carefully to unlock services but the password never leaves your phone. We can do this, it works, there’s even custom-made hardware to lock down precisely this kind of information. The person or company you want to connect with also creates a secure “password,” and with that password we each generate a public address or digital pseudonymous ID. 

The company encrypts a message with their password and your public address and sends you a message. Well, thanks to the magic of cryptography, you can decrypt that message with your password and the company’s public address. That is all we need to secure the web. These public IDs do not have to reveal any information about you and you could have one for every brand or identity you have online. 

Webs Of Trust

But there is also the question of reputation: How do you know that the company you are trying to connect with is who they claim to be? In cybersecurity, this is called a man-in-the-middle attack, where a malicious third party impersonates who you actually wish to connect to. 


The way cypherpunks solved this problem in the 90s was by developing the concept of webs of trust, through real-world ceremonies called “signing parties.”

When we meet in person, we decide that we trust each other or affirm that we already know and trust each other enough to co-sign each other’s public IDs. We give each other a cryptographic vote of confidence — so to speak —  weighed by our brand or publicly known nym. This is similar to giving a follow to someone on a public forum like Twitter; it is the PGP equivalent to saying “I’ve met Bob, I recognize XYZ as his public ID, and I vouch that he is real.”

While this sounds tedious, antiquated and like it would never scale to the whole world, technology has advanced a great deal since the 90s; in fact this fundamental logic is how the internet is sort of secured today.

Remember that green lock that used to be displayed on every website? That was a PGP-like cryptographic handshake between your computer and the website you were visiting, signed off by some certificate authority or third party out on the internet. Those certificate authorities became centralized custodians of public trust and like many other institutions today probably need to be decentralized.

The same logic can be applied to the verification and authentication of APKs, by scaling up webs of trust. In fact, in the open source world, software hashed into a unique ID derived from the data of the software, and that hash is signed by developer PGP keys to this day. The software hashes, PGP public IDs and signatures are all published alongside software for people to review and verify. 

However if you don’t know whether the PGP public ID is authentic, then the signature is not useful, since it could have been created by an impersonator online. As users we need a link that authenticates that public ID belongs to the real-world developer of the app.

The good news is that this problem can probably be solved without having to create a global surveillance state giving all our data to the Googles of the world. 

For example, if I wanted to download an app from a developer in Eastern Europe, I likely won’t know him or be able to verify this public ID, but perhaps I know someone who vouched for someone who knows this developer. While I may be three or four hops away from this person, the likelihood that they are real suddenly goes up a lot. Faking three or four hops of connection in a web of trust is very expensive for mercenary hackers looking to score a quick win. 

Unfortunately, these technologies have not been adopted widely, beyond the high-tech paranoid world,  nor gotten as much funding as the data mining business model of most of the web. 

Modern Solutions
Some modern software projects recognize this logic and are working to solve the problems at hand, making it easy for users to leverage and scale cryptographic webs of trust. Zapstore.dev, for example, is building an alternative app store secured by cryptographic webs of trust using Bitcoin-compatible cryptography, the project is funded by OpenSats, a nonprofit that funds open source, Bitcoin-related software development.

Graphene, an Android operating system fork that’s become popular among cybersecurity enthusiasts, has also implemented an alternative app store that addresses many of these issues without having to DOX app developers, and serves as a high-security operating system, looking to solve many of the privacy and security issues in Android today.

Far-fetched as it may seem, cryptographic authentication of communication channels and digital identities is the only thing that can protect us from personal data hacks. Entropy and the security created from randomness via cryptography are the only things AI cannot fake. That same cryptography can help us authenticate ourselves in the digital age without having to share our personal data with every intermediary out there, if we use it right.

Whether this new policy by Android is sustained, or whether enough public outcry can stop it and better solutions do get popularized and adopted remains to be seen, but the truth of the matter is clear. There is a better way forward, we just have to see it and choose it."

While there is every reason to be optimistic about Bitcoin’s impact on society it is not enough to rely on lines of code to fix our world. Rather, in this essay on the ethics of immutability, I argue that fixing oneself is the true revolution, and in turn, collectively, as actors in this global network, we are the revolution of change.

Bitcoin was designed to be decentralized, censorship-resistant, open source and unconfiscatable, qualities that set it apart from traditional banking and financial infrastructure. Bitcoin’s architecture means that no central authority can arbitrarily seize funds or block transactions on the network. The transparent, permissionless nature of its code allows anyone to participate without needing approval from intermediaries or gatekeepers. It empowers individuals to transact and store value beyond the reach of censorship, monetary debasement and financial repression by governments and banks.

These attributes have led many to view Bitcoin not just as a new form of money, but as an instrument of freedom in the digital age. In “On Revolution,” Hannah Arendt states 

“the life of a free man needed the presence of others. Freedom itself needed therefore a place where people could come together.” 

It is my hope that the coming together just might be a global, decentralized monetary network.

The framework and means by which we can serve as the instantiation of digital freedom has already been given to us — the actions of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator.

As Bitcoiners we often ask ourselves, “What does it mean to be a Bitcoiner?” Generally, responses include simply holding bitcoin, sending transactions, believing in the value of sound money, running a node or any combination thereof. 

Of course, these are necessary but insufficient, I argue, to be a Bitcoiner. One is not a Christian simply because one owns a Bible. Beliefs, and more importantly, one’s actions are necessary to uphold the ethos of Bitcoin. The community has not given enough credence to the fact that Satoshi gave up exorbitant wealth and fame so that we could freely take part in this network. It is this legacy and what it means for the users of Bitcoin that I explore in this paper. We must carry on this spirit of Satoshi by respecting and promoting the freedom of others, if we are to truly fix the world. 

The Immutability Legacy of Satoshi Nakamoto
By walking away, Satoshi Nakamoto embodied the principle that Bitcoin was meant to belong to its community, not to its creator or a central authority. Equally striking is Satoshi’s decision to remain anonymous. To this day, the true identity of Satoshi is unknown, and the creator’s forum posts and emails never revealed personal details. This anonymity was very much in line with the Cypherpunk ethos that influenced Bitcoin’s development, a culture that values privacy and letting ideas speak for themselves rather than relying on authority. Satoshi himself was explicit about avoiding any cult of personality. When a media frenzy in 2014 led to the mistaken “doxxing” of a Californian man (Dorian Nakamoto) as Bitcoin’s founder, the real Satoshi seemingly resurfaced online just to post the message, “I am not Dorian Nakamoto.” Beyond that clarification, the inventor never sought fame or credit. 

One of the most powerful symbols of Satoshi Nakamoto’s legacy is the fact that he never cashed in his bitcoin holdings. It is estimated that Satoshi mined roughly 1 million BTC (bitcoin) in the early days of the network. Remarkably, none of those coins have ever been moved or spent — they remain sitting untouched on the blockchain. At today’s market value, that stash would make Satoshi one of the wealthiest individuals on the planet. Yet the creator chose to leave that fortune alone. We do not know for certain why Satoshi never spent his coins. But the effect of this abstention has been profound. By not profiting from his invention, Satoshi demonstrated integrity and belief in the project’s long-term vision. Almost like a relic or monument on the blockchain, those unspent coins have become a reminder of his contribution and prove that the founder did not seek personal enrichment.

In the Bitcoin community, this fact is often cited to underline the purity of Bitcoin’s origins. The monetary system Satoshi created was decentralized and fair, giving early adopters an opportunity by not allowing the creator to abuse any special advantage. Satoshi actively gave up certain freedoms (like the freedom to cash out riches or the freedom to bask in fame) for the sake of Bitcoin’s success and credibility. This personal sacrifice set a powerful ethical example and established many of the values the Bitcoin community still holds dear: decentralization, open participation, neutrality and the idea that principles matter more than individual gain.

Satoshi’s coins, sitting untouched on the ledger, are an immutable timestamp of those values, reminding us that the founder’s commitment to freedom was not just in words but in deeds. This legacy invites us to reflect on the kind of community Bitcoin was meant to foster, and it provides a real-world segue into broader philosophical questions about freedom and responsibility, which, as Bitcoiners, we must consider as the instantiation of Bitcoin’s embodiment of freedom.

Bitcoin and the Concept of Freedom
What do we mean by “freedom,” especially in a social context? Philosophers have grappled with this question for centuries. One particularly illuminating perspective comes from the 20th-century existentialist Simone de Beauvoir, whose work “The Ethics of Ambiguity” (1947) explores the nature of freedom and the ethical responsibilities it entails. Beauvoir’s insights can help us draw parallels between Bitcoin’s ethos and a broader philosophy of reciprocal freedom and autonomy.

A key idea in Beauvoir’s ethics is that freedom is a shared, interdependent condition. She rejects the notion that freedom is simply the ability for an isolated individual to do anything they please. Instead, true freedom is “a positive and constructive process” that inevitably involves other human beings. One person’s freedom is enhanced by the freedom of others, and curtailed when others are oppressed. I cannot be truly free, she argues, if I live in a world where others are enslaved or silenced, because I exist in a human world of relationships and my own possibilities are intertwined with those of my fellow human beings. The authors of “Resistance Money” proclaim this ethos in their words:

“Cypherpunk code empowers individuals. But, with money, writing code is not enough. For money is, as we’ve seen, a network good. Bitcoin isn’t DIY money – do it yourself. It is, DIT – do it together. Using bitcoin means joining users in supporting resistance money for those who need it, with or without permission or cooperation of authorities.”

This logic of reciprocity means that we each have a responsibility to strive for the freedom of all, not just our own personal freedom. Beauvoir famously writes that the freedom of others must be respected and they must be helped to free themselves — how one might be freed by the ability to use a censorship-resistant monetary network, for example. It is not enough to refrain from coercing others; an authentic ethics calls us to actively support and expand the freedom of those around us. This could mean educating those who lack knowledge, fighting against unjust political structures that oppress people or working to alleviate poverty and other conditions that limit an individual’s opportunities. Freedom, in Beauvoir’s conception, is inherently social and cooperative. 

This philosophy resonates strongly with the ethos of open source, decentralized networks like Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s value proposition is not just that, “I individually control my money,” but also that everyone can participate as equals under the same rules. Contrast that structure with the status quo of Cantillon effects whose default is to embrace moral hazard. 

The Bitcoin network becomes more secure and useful as more people use it (more nodes, more miners, more liquidity), which is an illustration of freedom being mutually reinforcing. Rather than viewing freedom as a zero-sum game, modern thinkers like Beauvoir see it as inherently social and mutually enhancing, an insight that can apply to a monetary network as well. A decentralized currency works precisely because it is open and accessible to all; my financial freedom is bolstered by others joining and expanding the network effects. As more users adopt bitcoin, it becomes harder for any one authority to censor transactions for anyone — network decentralization is a form of reciprocal empowerment for its users. This reflects Beauvoir’s point that a person’s freedom can only extend itself by means of the freedom of others. 

True freedom is therefore reciprocal and we can see an analogue in Bitcoin’s philosophy: If a participant in the network (say a miner or node) tries to censor or cheat others, they undermine the very system that guarantees their own financial autonomy. Indeed, Bitcoin’s consensus rules make it so that acting to censor or double-spend will only harm the attacker — honest nodes will reject invalid blocks, and the attacker wastes resources. The network is structured to reward cooperation (following the rules) and make interference futile. While Beauvoir was talking about human rights and ethical relations, the parallel is that freedom to transact, like freedom of speech, works best when universally upheld. No one is truly “free” in a monetary sense if a central authority can freeze their account on a whim. Importantly, preventing others from transacting (for example, lobbying to censor certain addresses or users) would eventually jeopardize one’s own security and freedom on the network. 

It is important to acknowledge my words have not been written in the years following WWII; that despite the current tumult, American life is not likely to see a full-scale kinetic war as we did in the past century. 

We must then ask ourselves, what does revolution look like when there is no oppressor? And what does reciprocal freedom mean in 21st-century American life? While one could argue, like Arendt, that we live under an oligarchy, fiat as an economic system has no king or dictator to overthrow. A contemporary view of freedom warrants a dynamic approach to answering this question. Challenging oppression when there is no king is akin to technological creative destruction — a process not necessitating brute force but replacing the system from without.

American life is dominated by systems of oppression that tacitly affect our freedoms. It is futile to contrast the year 2025 to a century ago where a question of freedoms could more easily break down into simple positive and negative binaries. Rather, the restrictions to one’s freedoms in contemporary American life become more nebulous. Again, rendering questions such as: What freedoms are restricted when paid advertising affects our purchasing habits, social media controls the algorithms, processed foods affect our cognition, Citizens United lessens our influence in our democracy or for our current purposes when a financial and economic system decreases purchasing power and concentrates wealth by design? 

We live at a time of tremendous abundance and security, so it is easy to slip into passive engagement with community and political life; it is easy to slip into the way of being of a serious man (Beauvoir’s archetype of a person who avoids the responsibility of reciprocal freedom by following strict values as if they were fixed truths making them prone to justifying harmful actions in the name of their “sacred” cause). 

de Beauvoir’s also introduces a moral imperative: Solidarity in the pursuit of freedom. It’s not enough to avoid doing harm; we are called to get involved and work to change conditions that deny others their freedom. She observed that authentic ethics entails helping others expand their scope of action and choice. This could be read (in our context) as a call to support technologies or movements that empower people who have been excluded from traditional systems. Consider how Bitcoin has been used by dissidents, journalists or citizens in countries with capital controls and hyperinflation. Because Bitcoin is censorship-resistant and borderless, it allowed, for example, WikiLeaks to receive donations in 2010 when PayPal and banks (under government pressure) blocked funds. It has helped people in Venezuela or Zimbabwe bypass destructive monetary policies and hold savings in a currency that their rulers cannot debase. 

During the Russian-Ukraine war in 2022, Bitcoin donations were sent directly to Ukraine when traditional channels were constrained, a demonstration of the network’s neutrality and availability. It has also provided a way for migrant workers and refugees to carry and send assets when the banking system shuts them out.

All these cases reflect individuals reclaiming freedom in the face of oppression or hardship, aided by a global community of Bitcoin users and developers who maintain the network. To draw a parallel to Beauvoir: Those who contribute to Bitcoin’s development or adoption in repressive environments are, in a sense, helping others to free themselves. They are engaging in a form of solidarity that aligns with the ethical vision Beauvoir puts forth — a “concrete commitment to the freedom of our fellow men,” as she described it, which means actively standing against structures that limit others’ autonomy. Viewing Bitcoin through Beauvoir’s existentialist lens highlights the idea of reciprocal freedom. Bitcoin works as a system of augmented freedom not because it lets an individual escape society, but because it creates a new kind of society, one built on voluntary participation, equal rules and mutual empowerment rather than top-down control. It exemplifies the principle that my financial freedom is inextricable from yours. It challenges the community to uphold not only their own rights, but the rights of others, keeping the network open and accessible. As Beauvoir insisted, freedom gains meaning only when we devote ourselves to defending and enlarging the freedom of all.

Beauvoir’s sentiment is echoed in José Ortega y Gasset’s, “The Revolt of the Masses,” who calls us to understand that

“every destiny is dramatic, tragic in its deepest meaning. Whoever has not felt the danger of our times palpitating under his hand, has not really penetrated to the vitals of destiny, he has merely pricked its surface.”

While Ortega y Gasset applies this sentiment to the perceived treachery of his mass man it is nonetheless a statement of considerable importance. Beauvoir asks us to will ourselves free, in order to free others. The possibility of doing so is only met when the will seeks an understanding of the destiny of others, including the mass man. We understand the ambiguity of our own nature and destiny but freedom lies in the taking-on of the ambiguity of others.

The uncertainty of our nature is further illuminated by Craig Warmke in his paper, “Bitcoin Behind the Veil,” where he examines Bitcoin through John Harsanyi’s “veil” analysis. Warmke asks the question: “If you could not choose, [and were born again], in which kind of world would you prefer to live: a world with bitcoin, like our own, or a world without bitcoin, one like ours but where bitcoin had never been invented?” In our world where over half of the population lives under an authoritarian regime your chances of Western abundance and freedom is the flip of a coin, so the logical answer to his question is, “yes,” I would prefer to live in a world with bitcoin. 

Warmke’s argument is not simply a thought experiment, it is a call to action when we see the destiny of others, by mere chance, was not our own. We must then ask, what, if any, responsibility we, as Bitcoiners bear, to offset chance, and what does that mean for our lives — our immutability?

The Ethics of Immutability
One of Bitcoin’s defining technical features is the immutability of its blockchain ledger. Once a block of transactions is confirmed and added to the chain, it becomes effectively tamper-proof; the record is permanent. This idea of an unchangeable record of actions provides a rich metaphor for thinking about life, legacy and moral responsibility — a responsibility toward upholding and empowering the freedom of others. We might ask: If your life’s choices were encoded like transactions in an immutable ledger, would you be proud of the record? Are our actions, in a sense, etched in time as part of our legacy, and how does that influence the way we choose to live?

The notion of an “immutable essence” versus the possibility of a dynamic being has long been debated. Existentialist thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre argued that for human beings, “existence precedes essence.” By this, Sartre meant there is no predefined, unchanging soul or nature that determines what we are; rather, we continuously create ourselves through our choices and actions. We are, in Sartre’s words, “condemned to be free,” wholly responsible for shaping our identity and values in the absence of any fixed template given by God or nature. We define ourselves through our choices and actions. This emphasis on freedom and authenticity means that moral commitment is something we choose and enact, not something imposed by an immutable essence or fate. Every action contributes to the “ledger” of who we are. Sartre even suggested that in choosing for oneself, one should consider that they are, in a way, choosing an example for all humanity, a bit like every transaction you broadcast to the blockchain becomes part of a public history that others can see. 

Now, contrast this with other philosophical or religious views that do posit an immutable core to the self. In Plato’s philosophy and in many spiritual traditions, there is the idea of a soul, something fundamentally stable and divine in a person that persists through change. Plato, for instance, considered the soul immortal and unchanging in its essence. Some religious perspectives hold that salvation or enlightenment is about realizing one’s eternal, unchanging true nature. In such views, moral improvement might be seen as uncovering or manifesting an already existing goodness. On the other hand, there are also views that stress transformation, the idea that one must become something different.

Finally, at the opposite extreme, philosophies like Buddhism and David Hume’s empiricism deny any fixed self at all: They argue that the self is an illusion, a series of fleeting states with no enduring essence. Buddhism teaches anātman, “no-soul” that clinging to the notion of an immutable identity is a source of suffering, and liberation comes from recognizing the impermanence of all components of the self. Why do these abstract views matter in our context? Because they frame an ethical question: How should we live and engage with the world around us? If you believe you have an immutable soul, perhaps you strive to keep it pure and untarnished — you might act in ways that “timestamp” only what you would want eternally associated with you. (Think of a virtuous person wanting to leave a legacy as pristine as Satoshi’s untouched coins on the blockchain). 

If instead you believe that identity is something you create, then every choice is like mining a new block — an opportunity to add to the chain of your life in a meaningful way. And if you believe there is no permanent self, you might focus on the present consequences of actions rather than any lasting record, or you might find meaning in contributing to something larger (like how in Bitcoin, individual nodes come and go, but the ledger persists, similarly one might say individual lives are transient, but good deeds can have enduring effects beyond the self).

The concept of blockchain immutability prompts a thought experiment: What if our deeds truly could not be erased or forgotten? In reality, of course, human memory and history are fallible. But increasingly, in the digital age, we do have a kind of permanent memory (the internet never forgets, and the Bitcoin blockchain literally never forgets transactions). 

This imposes a new kind of moral transparency; it recalls the philosopher John Locke’s discussion of personal identity. Locke argued that it is continuous consciousness (memory of one’s actions) that constitutes personal identity even if the substance (the soul or body) changes, as long as consciousness of past actions persists, the person remains the same. He gave a famous scenario: If consciousness could be transferred from one soul to another, the person would go with the consciousness, not with the soul: 

“If consciousness can actually be transferred from one soul to another, then a person can persist, despite a change in the soul to which her consciousness is annexed.” 

In other words, for Locke the moral self is essentially the record of what you’ve thought and done — your “ledger” of consciousness. This idea dovetails intriguingly with the blockchain metaphor: Personal identity might be seen as a chain of memories and actions, an ongoing accumulation of “blocks” (experiences) linked by the awareness of them. An immutable ledger of one’s transactions is an externalization of memory; a permanent consciousness of certain actions. Thus, one could say that morally, we are (or ought to be) the sum of our remembered deeds. If we imagine those deeds are unalterable and public, it could encourage living in such a way that you don’t have to hide or erase anything. 

The concept of immutability calls us to an ethics of accountability as well. It suggests that integrity is about owning one’s past and working to build on it rather than cover it up. The idea of immutability relates to how we consider legacy and mortality. Ernest Becker, in “The Denial of Death,” spoke of people’s desire to achieve something that outlasts them, a “heroic” quest to create an immortal legacy in the face of our mortal lives. In a poetic sense, Bitcoin’s ledger gives everyone the chance to have a tiny immortal legacy: an address with some coins that might live on forever in the chain, or an inscription in a transaction (some have even embedded messages in Bitcoin’s blockchain). Of course, those are just data. But it raises a question of what kind of immortality really matters. The existentialist view would say the only immortality we can genuinely attain is to have our actions positively influence others and become part of the human story. To paraphrase, the only justification for our existence is whatever significance our actions have on the lives of others. Or as one contemporary actor puts it,

“If you are not making someone else’s life better, you are wasting your time.”

An immutable record by itself is meaningless unless what is recorded has value. So, while the Bitcoin network ensures that a transaction is remembered, it does not tell us what those transactions ought to be. That remains an ethical choice. The “ethics of immutability” might then mean: live in such a way that if your deeds were permanently recorded for all to see, they would represent the person you truly want to be. Live so that the “timestamp” of your life’s work has integrity and, in the spirit of Satoshi, is in service to others. Recognize that, unlike a blockchain, a human life is finite, which lends urgency to acting authentically and courageously now, rather than assuming one can always rewrite or delay.

There is no editing the chain after the fact. Reflecting on immutability connects to questions of personal identity and moral responsibility. Bitcoin’s unalterable ledger is a technological mirror of the philosophical idea that our actions, once done, become part of the tapestry of history and of who we are. Whether one leans more toward the view of a fixed inner soul or a self that is continuously created, in both cases one must confront the consequences of choices. The blockchain model tilts toward Locke and Sartre: You are your record (because there’s no secret essence, only evidence of what you’ve done). That perspective can inspire an ethic of honesty, transparency and consistency. It calls us to make each decision count, to uphold principles even when no one is watching, because on the Bitcoin network, in a sense everyone is always watching. It challenges us to leave behind a legacy that, like Bitcoin’s genesis block with its famous timestamp (“Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”), captures a principled stand for others to remember. The immutability of Bitcoin’s blockchain, metaphorically applied, invites us to strive for an immutable core of values, not in the sense that our character never changes, but that our commitment to certain ethical principles remains unwavering and is evident in our actions.

Bitcoin and a Call to Action
Exploring the philosophy behind Bitcoin and freedom is not a mere intellectual exercise; it has practical implications for how Bitcoiners choose to act. The convergence of ideas we have discussed — Satoshi’s legacy of selflessness and Beauvoir’s ethic of helping others to be free, and the metaphor of living transparently and intentionally — all point toward a modern call to action: to live in alignment with principles of freedom, authenticity and solidarity. 

Protecting and promoting freedom for others: If we take to heart Beauvoir’s dictum that “the freedom of other men must be respected and they must be helped to free themselves,” then a clear implication is to support systems and policies that expand people’s autonomy. In the context of finance and technology, this could mean contributing to open source projects, like Bitcoin, that give individuals more control over their own information and money. It could mean standing against censorship, not only in money but in speech and access to information. For example, technologists might develop censorship-resistant communication tools like Nostr inspired by the same spirit as Bitcoin. Advocates might push for legal protections for encryption and against financial surveillance that disproportionately harms dissidents or marginalized groups. Educators and community leaders can work to demystify technologies like Bitcoin for the general public (since knowledge is power), helping people understand how to use these tools is a way of freeing them from reliance on authorities. In short, actively helping others achieve greater freedom could involve anything from teaching a neighbor how to secure their digital privacy, to supporting human rights organizations that use Bitcoin to aid activists under authoritarian regimes. The key is the mindset of solidarity: recognizing, as Beauvoir did, that my freedom flourishes when I devote myself to the freedom of all. Bitcoin’s community, at its best, has exemplified this through global outreach, establishing Bitcoin circular economies, translations of educational material and donations in crises. 

Building legacy through action: While the Bitcoin blockchain is immutable, our lives are not, which is a good thing. We can change, improve and adapt. The ethics outlined here encourages authentic transformation rather than complacency. Beauvoir admired those who remained passionate and engaged with improving the human condition rather than those who sunk into cynicism and apathy. In the Bitcoin world, this is analogous to the builders and educators who are constantly trying to make the ecosystem better and more accessible, versus speculators who might treat it as a mere get-rich-quick scheme. The call to action is to be the former. 

Simone de Beauvoir wrote that authentic ethics demands “a concrete commitment” to others and to values, and that one should stand against conditions that oppress or hinder other people, and work to change those conditions. As Bitcoiners, “opting out” simply masquerades as action, but Bitcoin is only revealed through action with and for others. In our context, action could include political activism for civil liberties, economic activism like promoting financial literacy or inclusion or technological activism such as contributing to decentralized protocols that counter monopolies.

For instance, individuals inspired by Bitcoin’s success might support other open source efforts in secure communication, or advocate against laws that seek to weaken encryption. They might join local initiatives to support people unbanked or underbanked, showing them alternatives like Bitcoin or simply helping them gain access to any banking since the goal is expanding choice. It is worth noting the Bitcoiners who are fulfilling this call to action already: Anita Posch who is educating thousands in Africa about Bitcoin, Hermann Vivier and Luthando Ndabambi who have created a Bitcoin circular economy in their small South African community, L0la33tz‘s privacy advocacy, Andreas Antonopoulos whose early Bitcoin advocacy was vital to Bitcoin adoption, Alex Gladstein’s tireless efforts with the Human Rights Foundation, among so many more.

Giving a Damn: Satoshi’s legacy and Bitcoin are a call to action to fix ourselves. It was not only the benevolent acts of Bitcoin’s creator that placed this duty upon us but also the understanding that just as the architecture of money has now undergone an upgrade we, too, can seek this for ourselves. While I commend and am excited to have witnessed what this has meant for many Bitcoiners over the years, who have sought ways of improving their lives through health and financial security, betterment must not stop there, as Beauvoir and others have shown us. Yes, one may be seeking perfection of mind and body but without action we risk being buoys on the waves. While foundational, not going beyond one’s betterment, is no more impactful on society than the isolated and solitary monk seeking nirvana.

The only way to gain true freedom; to not be subject to or affected by (a particular undesirable thing), is to not have to rely on a third party in the first place. If freedom means a lack of outside influence on your autonomy, then by default there is an increase in personal responsibility for your choices. Individual rights should not be inversely related to individual responsibility. So it is, in fact, the duty of reciprocal freedom we have to each other and to our communities. We must look toward a new version of ourselves if we are to seek a new version of economy and society, for we are the actors in this new paradigm. Bitcoin invites us to look at discarding traditional ways of thinking and analyzing our world. If we can imagine a new form of money, we can also imagine a new body politic: the absence of Right versus Left. We can imagine what giving, compassion and philanthropy means through the lens of Bitcoin — “free and ready to stretch out toward a new future.” Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, so too is revolution always and everywhere a human phenomenon — not simply a technology. 

We are reminded that freedom is not a given, nor is the promise of Bitcoin — “a freedom can not will itself without willing itself as an indefinite movement.” It must be continually defended and expanded through our choices. Each of us, like a node in a decentralized network, has a role to play in upholding the freedom of the whole. By remaining anonymous and not cashing out, Satoshi asked to not be placed on a pedestal; instead, it is up to us, the users, to carry the mission forward. And as Beauvoir would insist, that mission is meaningless unless it is done for everyone’s benefit. The authenticity of our cause will be judged by whether we indeed make life freer for others, especially the least free. Our words and actions can live on as an immutable ledger in the minds of others, an obvious conclusion, but one whose full weight and impact is not understood until you consider your own legacy. In other words, the ledger that embodies action is the ledger that lives in the memories’ of others forever.

In practice, let this translate into everyday actions: supporting policies that enhance privacy rights, teaching someone about personal financial sovereignty, resisting the temptation to engage in censorship or discrimination, and building technologies that resist coercion. As we do so, we should keep asking ourselves the hard questions Beauvoir posed: 

“Am I really working for the liberation of men? Isn’t this end contested by the means I use to attain it?”

This reflective attitude guards against fanaticism and ensures that freedom as an ideal is not used to justify new forms of oppression. In Bitcoin’s context, it means balancing idealism with humility and constant re-examination of our own aims, a balance that can be struck through pause and reflection. The majority of us are not entrepreneurs or developers, but we can will others free by giving them a voice to be heard not — stifled or contested in the moment. To validate someone else’s lived experience is to give the freedom of consciousness — of identity, upon which all other positive freedoms must build.

Bitcoin’s creation, by an anonymous person who never sought wealth or power, is a profound gesture toward freedom. Our community, if we resist ossifying into dogma or tribalism, can continue that gesture. But if it becomes a tool for exclusion, greed or ideological purity, it betrays its promise to be infinitely more than what it would be if it were reduced to being what it is. Bitcoin is ethically meaningful only when it serves as a movement toward freedom, especially for those previously denied it. Our conclusion is to see Bitcoin not simply as a financial asset or a mere technical development, but as part of a broader ethical project: building a world where individuals can transact, speak, create and live according to their own will and conscience, limited only by the equal freedom of others. Achieving this will require intentional living, courageous action and an unyielding commitment to both innovation and freedom. 

The tools are in our hands; the ledger is before us. The next blocks, the next pages of our own history and Bitcoin’s, will be written by what we choose to do now."
2025-08-28,Nunchuk Wallet Brings Programmable Bitcoin To Everyone With Miniscript Support - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNZEJVcDFsRXpsRVdzb1Z4ME92amwtY2t2aDZRY0oyN1RSTlozc1A3NkV2UVdxV1hXTVpQVDIzdk55ZzZuWWtYUlVKRUtSTm8wUHNrSWxRQTlFemVlNFNoZS1OQktldFFCUlBxNVdPQklZS1RwdXdVcXRTWi1sWFVjalFDdl9OMjRzYUZ2MnYwR2Qxb0l5WmNNVzZGLWpMd21FQzZSQ0w1YzVCSnlTdHdXbVAyMk5Ibmxq?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today Nunchuk Wallet releases support for fully generalized Miniscript use, bringing a degree of flexibility and control to their users not seen before. 

For those unfamiliar with Miniscript, it is a policy language invented by Core developer and former Maintainer Pieter Wuille to make the creation of customized Bitcoin scripts easier and safer. Miniscript takes the most commonly used pieces of Bitcoin script, i.e. signature locks, timelocks, hashlocks, etc. and creates a “higher level” programming language for users to create custom scripts. 

This higher level language is designed to be safely analyzable and composable, meaning that once users create a customized script they can be sure that it will behave exactly how they expect it to. 

Nunchuk provides two basic templates users can use, simply needing to fill in the keys they wish to use in the wallet. One is a decaying multisig, where after a timelock expires less keys are required to spend in order to ensure that key loss does not result in losing funds. The other is an expanding multisig, where over time other keys can sign for a transaction beyond the core key set. I.e. initially a 2-of-2 is required, but after a timelock a third key can sign instead. 

In addition to these basic templates, more advanced users can import any custom Miniscript template they have created themselves.

Miniscript templates can be applied to both Native Segwit wallets as well as Taproot wallets. 

Out of the gate, the following hardware wallets will support Native Segwit Miniscript: Coldcard, Tapsigner, Blockstream Jade, and Ledger. 

The following will support Taproot Miniscript: Coldcard and Ledger. 

MuSig2 use with Miniscript will be limited to software only keys for the time being. 

Nunchuk’s end-to-end encrypted communication function has full support for Miniscript templates, allowing collaboration between users in constructing and using template based wallets. 

In addition, Nunchuk has compiled a 101 Technical Guide for users who wish to make use of Miniscript in their wallets. For those more inclined to dive into the nuts and bolts themselves, here is also a website put together by Pieter Wuille with a breakdown of Miniscript itself and some basic tools. "
2025-08-27,Lightning Is Misunderstood - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE9JZVRCLXVjRGR1NTNKT3FaOXBwUFB2cVNoR2ZFWUlOdHNqVEl5aTNYX2pKVktGQ2RvekdVX3cyQVdrZFhsSDNJNVBxSFBFWEg3ZUdvdmZ4aUV4TWh6SE1lUkloUmZ2YjRHSVNPRQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Lightning Network is one of the most exciting and innovative technologies built on Bitcoin, but it’s also one of the most misunderstood. From its early days with grassroots efforts like “PLEBNET,” to ambitious visions of Lightning Applications (LApps), and the idea of earning passive yield as a routing node operator, enthusiasm around Lightning has often outpaced its practical realities.

Many Bitcoiners expected Lightning to be a seamless, plug-and-play extension of the Bitcoin network — just as sovereign, decentralized, and accessible as running a full Bitcoin node. But the reality is more complex. Setting up and maintaining a well-connected Lightning node involves technical skills and capital requirements that most users aren’t prepared to manage. This isn’t a failure: It’s simply a reflection of Lightning’s design.

As a result of these barriers, many users have turned to custodial solutions to access Lightning’s benefits. Custodial wallets and neobanks like Strike, Blink, Wallet of Satoshi, Cash App and others offer features such as Lightning URLs, instant low-fee transactions, and the kind of reliability and user experience people expect from full-featured, banking-style apps. To some, this reliance on custodians feels like a compromise, and in a way, it is. But more importantly, it reveals something often overlooked: Running Lightning infrastructure isn’t meant for everyone.

Here’s the controversial part: That’s perfectly okay.

Lightning’s critics, both within the Bitcoin community and among altcoin promoters, often frame these trade-offs as proof that Lightning has failed, suggesting it should be replaced with something else entirely. But that view misses the mark. Rather than seeing these limitations as fatal flaws, it’s far more accurate and productive to understand the Lightning Network for what it truly is: enterprise-grade infrastructure.

In this context, “enterprise-grade” means robust, scalable, and dependable enough to power real-time, low-fee payments for mission-critical services. It’s not something every casual user will host themselves. Lightning is built for professional operators — Bitcoin exchanges, payment processors, wallet developers, and technically capable community projects. For them, Lightning isn’t a compromise, it is a competitive advantage.

Moreover, the Lightning Network complements Bitcoin in many important ways and is becoming increasingly interoperable with adjacent technologies such as ecash mints and other layer-2 solutions. It functions as a global, open source, and permissionless financial infrastructure that any serious operator, anywhere in the world, can tap into. In essence, the Lightning Network is evolving into the interoperable glue connecting external systems to the Bitcoin blockchain.

Not everyone will run a Lightning node, and that’s okay. This reality doesn’t diminish Lightning’s significance in Bitcoin’s scaling roadmap. On the contrary, Lightning is a foundational layer that enables a wide range of tools and services. Far from being a centralizing force, it actually enhances decentralization by opening the door to permissionless payments anywhere in the world, creating new types of economic actors that weren’t previously possible.

A great example of this is the Kenyan Bitcoin payments app Tando. This app allows users to spend bitcoin at any merchant or service that accepts M-PESA using the Lightning Network. 

M-PESA is a mobile money platform launched by Safaricom in Kenya that allows users to send, receive, and store money via mobile phones without needing a traditional bank account. As of 2024, it serves over 34 million users in Kenya, processes more than 30 billion transactions annually, and accounts for nearly 60% of the country’s GDP. 

Thanks to Lightning, Tando’s creators can build a seamless, programmatic payment experience that interoperates directly with the M-PESA system, dramatically improving liquidity access for Bitcoin users in Kenya. Because everyone and their grandma in Kenya accepts M-PESA, now with Tando, anyone can spend bitcoin anywhere in Kenya — even in the Maasai Mara.

Without Lightning, on-chain Bitcoin payments would simply be too slow to offer a practical experience for everyday M-PESA transactions. Transaction confirmation times on-chain aren’t suited to real-time payments, especially in fast-paced retail settings. But by building a Lightning payment gateway that connects directly to M-PESA wallets, Tando has transformed the payment landscape for Bitcoin users in Kenya. Tando is proof that Lightning unlocks real-world use cases for builders without needing to ask for permission to build. The fact that Lightning enables this is amazing.

Another excellent example of the edge Lightning gives businesses can be seen by comparing two global neobanks: PayPal and Strike.

PayPal, the original internet payment company, launched in 1998 and took over 17 years to expand to more than 200 countries. In contrast, Strike, a far more niche application built on Lightning and launched in 2020, has already rolled out to over 100 countries in just five years, reaching markets across Africa, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific. Strike’s global expansion not only rivals PayPal’s in scope but also dramatically outpaces it in speed and ease, highlighting the unique advantages of building on modern, borderless infrastructure like the Lightning Network.

Strike CEO Jack Mallers and his team largely bypassed working directly with banks, instead choosing to partner with Bitcoin exchanges around the world that already had established local banking relationships in the markets they serve. These partners use the Lightning Network to send value instantly across borders. When a user wants to convert their Strike app balance into local currency, the partner facilitates the exchange on the back end. This strategy allowed Strike to launch a global payments service powered by universally accepted, instant Lightning payments faster than ever before.

Strike leveraged Bitcoin and Lightning’s borderless capabilities to build a truly global network, combining this technical edge with strong business development to secure fiat conversion partnerships. While legacy players remain bottlenecked by traditional banking rails, Strike uses Lightning to instantly move value anywhere on the planet.

Not only does the Lightning Network open new doors for businesses, but it also enables permissionless payments both large and small within other open protocols. A premier example of this is Nostr, a decentralized protocol designed to support social media experiences and much more.

In a post on X, Jack Dorsey stated, “The greatest at-scale example of Bitcoin as everyday payments are Zaps on Nostr.” In a 2023 interview with Politico, he discusses his grounded optimism for both Nostr and Lightning-enabled zaps:

“He also argued that the user experience on NOSTR had already surpassed that of Twitter, citing ‘Zaps’ a feature that lets users tip each other in Bitcoin — part of a vision in which information and money flow together around the internet without obstruction.”

Zaps on Nostr evolved from a basic Lightning invoice system to a seamless micropayment feature largely thanks to the efforts of William Casarin, known as jb55. Initially, users had to attach Bitcoin payment requests to notes manually. But in early 2023, Casarin, the creator of the Damus client, authored NIP-57, introducing event types 9734 (zap request) and 9735 (zap receipt), which formalized zaps as instant, Lightning-powered bitcoin transfers.

Building on Nostr’s early Lightning integration, Casarin’s vision helped transform zaps into a native, user-friendly feature across every prominent Nostr client. The introduction of zaps sparked a surge in Nostr adoption: By June 2023, Nostr users had sent over 1 million zaps across a network with roughly half a million users.

Requiring only a Lightning wallet and a Nostr client, zaps eliminated intermediaries and empowered creators to receive direct, low-fee payments for their posts, streams, or other content. This seamless integration of social interaction and Bitcoin’s Lightning economy has redefined the way value is exchanged online, one small or large transaction at a time.

Even though casual users typically won’t manage their own always-online Lightning infrastructure, the network empowers small teams and skilled individuals to offer financial services that once required a bank. This dynamic is rapidly evolving into a broader trend, one that’s driving Lightning toward greater decentralization through community-based infrastructure.

Imagine if every local Bitcoin meetup had someone running a Lightning node for their community. This could provide a neighborhood or region with an approachable, trusted operator, almost like modern-day credit unions. In such a model, Lightning infrastructure wouldn’t be dominated solely by large enterprise nodes. Instead, trust and routing would be distributed among smaller, localized actors with different incentives, builders who prioritize resilience, privacy, and accessibility over scale or profit.

This dynamic is also already happening today! I’ve personally seen this in action through initiatives like Praia Bitcoin in Brazil and La Crypta in Argentina. Both projects pair grassroots communities with locally managed payment systems built on Lightning. Together, Bitcoin and the Lightning Network are enabling a grassroots alternative to traditional banking — and it’s a beautiful thing.

Lastly, I would be remiss not to mention the many incredible projects like Zeus, Phoenix, Breez, Aqua, Muun, and other Lightning wallets that are innovating to create diverse user experiences. These teams are building feature-rich applications without sacrificing user custody while navigating the still-wild frontier of Bitcoin payments in 2025. In a world where Bitcoin and Lightning remain niche, and speculative behavior is as rampant as ever, delivering excellent noncustodial payment experiences is no small feat. While not perfect, many of these projects are doing exactly that. The fact that so many builders are offering such a wide range of ways to interact with Lightning gives consumers real choice and ultimately reinforces my core argument.

The Lightning Network was never meant to serve every user in every way and that’s precisely why it works. It’s not failing because casual users may prefer custodial wallets. It’s succeeding because developers, businesses, and organizers are using it to solve real-world problems without needing permission.

What Lightning offers isn’t universal simplicity, it’s focused, high-leverage software. It’s infrastructure that bridges Bitcoin to people, and delivers innovative solutions to the edges of the global economy. When we stop expecting Lightning to be something it can’t be, we begin to understand its true purpose: a dynamic, foundational layer for those building the future of financial freedom."

It’s hard to think that this natural paradise was once the battleground of Latin America’s most savage and violent gangs for decades. According to a UNICEF report, the homicide rate in 2015 was 103 per 100,000 inhabitants. The result was thousands of children orphaned and vulnerable to be recruited by the drug cartels, where the only option for a better life seemed to be to migrate to the United States.

Chimbera was born in the community of El Zonte, where opportunities were divided by a road which separated the beach from the mountains. “In the past if you were born on the beach, you were a fisherman, like my father and grandfather. If you were born in the mountains, you were a farmer; while women were mainly housewives. The only hope for a better future for young people was to emigrate to the United States or Canada. We learned with sadness that the opportunities were there, the land of freedom where dreams supposedly came true. Paradoxically, these words come from a smiling face. It is very easy to fall in love with Román Martínez’s smile; known as “Chimbera” to his closest friends and family. His contagious joy comes from someone who knows in depth the darkest sides a society can fall into. His smile tells a story of collective overcoming, where a group of people believed that a better future was possible and, without expectations but with tireless determination, transformed a fishing village in one of the poorest and most violent countries in the world into a hub of technological innovation and human development. Something unusual in modern history.

Chimbera looks to the sky before continuing to reflect on dreams. “We believe in God and in the law of attraction of different things, but it is fundamental to believe in something that moves you to commit and work every day for that dream.  In the beginning, the dream was to help kids have more opportunities in the community, keep them out of delinquency and get them to start dreaming.” The problem, Román highlights, is that many times they tell you “fight for your dreams” but they don’t give you the tools or the knowledge to be able to achieve them. “That’s how our dream began: Jorge meeting with the children on the street, supporting them and inspiring them to dream of a better future.

It’s hard not to get emotional with Jorge Valenzuela as he tearfully explains why they decided to create Hope House. “We sought to give these children the opportunities that our friends didn’t have and the reason why many of them are no longer here with us.” Like most of the residents of El Zonte, he too has a story to tell. Some twenty years ago, Jorge made his living from farming. He had a heart for surfing and the waves, but the sad reality around him forced him to keep his feet on the ground. At that time, the job market only offered two options: to become a gang member or to be hired as private security on a property. The sad and violent reality of those years presented a dead end. “There was a lack of employment, educational and personal development opportunities in general. Faced with this, many sought to emigrate and look for them elsewhere,” Jorge explains clearly.

During those years, in the mornings, when the sun began to peek over the mountains, Jorge knew what he wanted to do. He would take his board and go down to the black sand beach. There, on his back, with his board stuck in the sand and his eyes on the horizon, Hirvin was waiting for him. Together they learned to read the sea, to feel the direction of the wind. They used to warn strangers about the treacherous currents that dragged the unsuspecting out to sea, and over time they began to pass on their knowledge of the sea and surfing to the youngest members of the community. Patience is the greatest virtue of surfers, for those who know how to wait are the ones who manage to ride the perfect wave. Both spent their afternoons sitting on their boards, looking for the best strategy to get ahead, to help their community. It was there, floating in the sea, where Hirvin and Jorge identified an area with enormous potential. “We took tourism as a main tool, as a window that would connect us with other countries, to whom we could show the beauty of our land and invite them to visit our community”. They were confident that they could generate new jobs in the town. “I was a surf instructor at the time and I felt that this sport would be fundamental for everything that happened later in El Zonte,” says Jorge.

No one could have imagined that on that beach, surrounded by humble houses and dirt roads, the world’s first Bitcoin circular economy would emerge. Soon, Jorge and Hirvin’s paths would cross with the person who would change their lives. “For some twist of fate, people like Mike, Melissa, Carlos and Alex decided to move to El Zonte and dedicate their time and effort to help our community,” recalls Jorge. The beach and surfing were their rallying point. “We were kids, I remember they started teaching us English, they put us in contact with the tourists that were arriving, and that cultural exchange was what began to change our minds. This allowed us to dream, something we were not used to in El Zonte. They showed us that, no matter the circumstances, if we have dreams and commit to them, things can change.” Jorge evokes the figure of Mike Peterson and, in a moment, he realizes that his life could have been very different if he had not met him.

With Mike’s incorporation into the project, they began to systematize the community work on the beach. The idea was simple: create opportunities and hope for young people. Empower them as leaders and give them the necessary tools so that they do not have to emigrate or get involved in gangs. Fill the “children’s love tank,” as Jorge defines it in his own words. “When we were little they taught us some words in English, they helped us to read and write better, but it was when my daughter, who is 17 today, was born that I understood that we had been children with an empty love tank.” A community where children grew up without parents or older siblings present to give them love, support and an example to follow. “We all have a tank, it can be empty or it can be filled with love and hope. That’s what the kids in our community needed.”

Mike wasn’t just a blue-eyed gringo who came to El Zonte and fell in love with its beaches and people. Peterson arrived as a surfer but soon became a dream maker.

The announcement comes as FTSE Russell confirmed Metaplanet’s inclusion in the FTSE Japan Index, upgrading the company from small-cap to mid-cap status in its September 2025 semi-annual review. The index inclusion, set to take effect after market close on September 19, marks a significant milestone for corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies.

“Another important milestone on our journey as Japan’s leading Bitcoin treasury company,” Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich wrote on X (formerly Twitter). The company’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy aims to accumulate 210,000 BTC.

The latest purchase was partially funded through the exercise of 49,000 stock acquisition rights between August 18-22, which added 4.9 million shares to the company’s total outstanding shares, now reaching 722 million. This financing mechanism, while diluting existing shareholders, enables continued Bitcoin accumulation without depleting cash reserves.

Metaplanet’s inclusion in the FTSE Japan Index creates a regulated route for BTC exposure and paves the way for other Bitcoin-forward companies to join major benchmarks. Passive flows into the FTSE indices could channel institutional capital into Metaplanet, offering indirect Bitcoin exposure.

The company’s transformation from a traditional hotel group to Asia’s most active Bitcoin treasury firm reflects a broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption. In the past month alone, five public companies have announced significant Bitcoin treasury initiatives, including Ming Shing Group’s $483 million purchase and KindlyMD’s $679 million acquisition.

The integration of Bitcoin-heavy companies into traditional equity indices presents new challenges for institutional investors. While passive inflows through index inclusion could boost liquidity and long-term stability, large movements in Bitcoin prices could create unexpected volatility for passive investors.

Eric Trump, who joined Metaplanet as a strategic adviser in March, is expected to attend the company’s next shareholder meeting in Tokyo in September. His involvement highlights the growing intersection between traditional finance and Bitcoin treasury strategies.

As more corporations adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies, the line between traditional equity investments and Bitcoin exposure continues to blur. Metaplanet’s FTSE inclusion may serve as a template for other companies looking to balance Bitcoin treasury operations with mainstream market participation.

The trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption shows no signs of slowing, with analysts expecting more companies to announce Bitcoin treasury initiatives in the coming months.

Nestled in a pack of Cardsmith’s Currency trading cards, an Arizona-based collector recently unveiled a 1 BTC card, which comes with a redemption code that entitles the holder to claim a full Bitcoin. The top cryptocurrency is currently trading just under $115,000, as of this writing.

“I didn’t think it was a serious possibility,” the anonymous collector told card manufacturer Cardsmiths.

Cardsmiths’ Currency series cards offer redemption cards for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dogecoin–with the biggest redemption offerings being for 1 BTC or 1 ETH.

Someone Just Won $100K in Bitcoin From a $50 Pack of Trading Cards

Collectors can purchase the packs of currency-themed cards for as low as $13.25 apiece (based on the size of the pack bundle), with 1:192 odds of pulling a crypto redemption—resulting in more than an 865,000% gain based on today’s Bitcoin price.

The recent pull marks at least the third full Bitcoin redemption in the last year via Cardsmiths, with other lucky collectors pulling full Bitcoin cards from $33 and $50 packs, respectively. 

Though entitled to the full Bitcoin, the most recent collector said they are only keeping 0.5 BTC of it thanks to a pledge they made on Reddit prior to pulling the card.

“First, let me introduce myself: I'm the crazy Ape who made a promise a while back that some of you may vaguely remember,” the Reddit user named decoparts posted to the Currencytradingcards subreddit. “To recap: I was documenting my pulls from a bunch of S4 Currency cards I had saved up, and I pledged that I would give half of the after-tax value to a charity, out of whatever crypto I found.”

“Boy, was I in for a lesson on backing up my promises and putting my money where my mouth is,"" they added.

Though Cardsmiths’ Series 4 Currency cards are all sold out online, its most recent SPACE Series holds unredeemed full Bitcoin cards, with packs that sell for as little as $13.75 via its online store.

The odds of walking away with crypto remain long though, with only 1 of every 192 packs expected to provide a crypto redemption card—the same odds the recent lucky collector faced.

While the jury is still out as to whether bitcoin — and cryptocurrency in general — will be a viable asset over the long run, there’s no denying the massive price increase bitcoin has enjoyed. As of Aug. 12, 2025, the price of bitcoin sat at $119,681.14, according to CoinMarketCap. This compares with a price of just $7,200 on Jan. 1, 2020. For those fortunate enough to hold bitcoin over this entire period, that amounts to an astonishing gain of 1,562.24% over five and a half years.

One of the things to remember about bitcoin, however, is that it is extremely volatile. While the gains can be breathtaking, so too can the selloffs. As people tend to get emotional about trading — panicking during drawdowns and becoming euphoric during rallies — it’s likely that numerous bitcoin holders sold out of the cryptocurrency during one of its famous crashes, like in 2022. So, if you’re considering making bitcoin a major part of your portfolio, be sure you understand the risk involved and the reasons why it trades as wildly as it does.

With that in mind, here’s a look at how much you could have made each year between 2020 and 2025 if you have invested in bitcoin.

With the exception of the horrible selloff in 2022, bitcoin has performed admirably. But even those that sold at the December 2022 price of $16,547.50 more than doubled their money if they bought in at $7,200 on Jan. 1, 2020. There’s simply no denying that over the past five years, bitcoin has been a great place to be. For investors who took their lumps in 2022 and held on, they’ve enjoyed huge gains in every other year over the past five.

The question going forward, of course, is if bitcoin will continue making these stellar gains or if it will round trip back down to $7,200, or perhaps even lower. You can find arguments for both outcomes among various analysts and financial pundits. Billionaire CEO Warren Buffett, for example, has called bitcoin “probably rat poison squared.” But Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest, says that even in a bearish scenario bitcoin should hit $300,000 by 2030 — and $3.8 million or more in the best-case scenario.

Each investor has to make their own determination as to how much bitcoin (or other cryptocurrency) they add to their portfolios. However, it’s only appropriate for those with a high risk tolerance, and even then, in small amounts. Many financial advisors recommend an allocation of somewhere between 0% and 5% of your portfolio into cryptocurrency.

Dominant narratives, actual actions, and real impact has become completely dominated by either the Suitcoiners, clownish Wall Street types building the exact same kind of degenerate leveraged financial products on top of Bitcoin that caused the 2008 financial crisis, or the Degens, completely degenerate Ordinals obsessed cypherpunks with a moronic fixation on the notion of ascribing ownership to jpegs stored on the blockchain. 

It’s frankly kind of disgusting and embarrassing that things have gotten to this point in this space. All meaningful drivers to growth and adoption are pulling people into a culture of brain dead suit-think completely devoid of any understanding or grasp of the true value that Bitcoin offers, censorship resistance and decentralization, or a culture of using those things for the stupidest most meaningless drivel imaginable rather than truly impactful uses that can change lives in a positive way. 

But here we are nonetheless. 

These two opposite and self-reinforcing echo chambers are dominating the stage. They are running the biggest booths ushering new entrants into the ecosystem. Yes, individuals can and will walk their own path, and some newcomers might stumble down some of those, but most won’t. Most will wind up following the Suitcoiners or the Degens. 

In that political reality, I will stand with the Degens. 

Everything they engage in is inane, moronic, pointless imaginary nonsense, but they at least appreciate and understand censorship resistance and the decentralization that creates it. They appreciate the value of self custody and tools that allow them to do what they want with their own money without needing to seek permission from someone else. 

The Suitcoiners understand none of these things. They don’t care about self custody. They think that decentralization is just a magic buzzword, or some characteristic set in granite rather than a dynamic property that can ebb and flow. They don’t care about the value a censorship resistant unstoppable monetary network can bring to society. They just care about making dollars in the safe walled garden of the legacy system. 

Bitcoin begins to lose all of the properties that give it a chance at resetting the world, of creating a level and neutral playing field for everyone, if its decentralization is eroded away. Without those things it becomes nothing more than a scarce asset trapped in the legacy walled garden. No permissionless money, no native currency of the internet, just a new stonk people buy like an S&P index fund. 

That is the direction the Suitcoiners will take us in if left unchecked or unopposed. So begrudgingly, I have to side with the Degens. I may have nothing in common with them except an actual appreciation and regard for censorship resistance, but that’s what really matters at the end of the day.

2025-08-21,Bitcoin Price Therapist - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE15NkJmbkdCeVVkbFNSc3otRWo4eUZfQmlvSGFqMzNDUjVxYVBOcTBXX08wbGJnQnlVMXpCb2lVWjAwNWJfa2dzWWh2T2ZpQXlsaXJRTUlBMUhWbFFWS0hYTWRiSWtNX00?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I hate it when the bitcoin price falls — like it did this week, first from $118,000 to $115,000, and then $115,000 to $113,000 (and then $112,000 while I was writing; rude). It’s nerve-wrecking, terrifying and straight-up infuriating. We’re on this unavoidable monetary revolution and every identifiable sign is pointing in the same, upward direction — alas, the world won’t cooperate and here we are, looking at an otherwise pretty standard -10%-from-top drawdown. 

I get it, it sucks when sways of your net wealth disappear in stomach-churning moves. Advice: don’t ever calculate the dollar amount of what, e.g., the recent -9.2% pullback amounted to for you. Don’t ever look at how many dollars you incinerated in “buying the dip” too early or “catching the knife” while our favorite orange miracle was in free fall.

The Bitcoin Price Didn’t Fall Because Some Talking Head Said Something
On Bitcoin Magazine, like any other financial media involved in click-hungry news, we routinely publish articles about the bitcoin price moving in relation to some macro or political news. It’s not that we, or anybody else, actually believe that price moved on the words of some politician or because Saylor bought more corn or because Metaplanet issued additional stock or because some Hong Kong-based treasury company nobody ever heard of stacked some sats. The bitcoin price didn’t move because the third sentence in Chairman Powell’s latest statement was slightly different than expected.

There’s no sane, rational reason why the bitcoin price ought to hold a certain level (or increase or decrease) because the White House prepares some executive order.

We have plenty of tea leaves readers and technical analysts and macro commentators pitching in, convinced that they know why the bitcoin price moved this way or that. Nobody knows. Bitcoin is too big a macro asset these days to be shoved around by fluff: It moves on the same ethereal and unpredictable changes that move any other asset class — sentiments, liquidity flow, animal spirits, etc. 

We publish these bitcoin price articles because you search for them and click on them and read them. You vote with your eyeballs as much as with your dollars. If you want better journalism, be the change you want to see in the world — read the good stuff instead of the fast-food trash with macroeconomic shelf life of a half-eaten apple (the fruit, not $APPL!).

Here’s a decent enough definition of (efficient) financial markets: all market participants’ best guesses of the future state of things, appropriately discounted back to the present. 

Everything — including, but certainly not limited to, hot news takes like the Trump Administration issuing executive orders or some treasury company buying more bitcoin or issuing more shares — goes into that aggregation-formulaic statement, and out comes a price shift.

Welcome to financial markets. 

You can come at this with technical analysis, and you’d almost never be right; you can make some serious model analysis of liquidity flow or short sellers, etc, and you’ll routinely be proven wrong. No price is beholden to a “psychological limit” of a round number or a 200-day moving average. Price does whatever it does. 

All we can do, as good bitcoin price therapists, is deal with it. Buy more, sell some chairs or kidneys, or close the screen and go for a walk. Nobody knows if hyperbitcoinization is here next week or next century, even though it makes a world of difference to your personal finances which one it is.

David Bailey, Chief Executive Chairman of BTC Inc, the owner of Bitcoin Magazine, and the Forrest Gump of Bitcoin, merged his Nakamoto with KindlyMD and finally got to unleash his war chest of almost $700 million to buy bitcoin. He hit the (local?) top, as so many bitcoin-savers have done over the years, and instantly incinerated about $36 million. (The Swedish treasury company H100 — of which I experimentally hold [very little] stock — was even funnier, hitting a 100 BTC+ purchase at almost $121,000; have fun trashing a million dollars.)

Fun times. 

Here are some other potentially price-moving things that happened recently: 

Treasury Secretary Bessent said the U.S. wouldn’t buy bitcoin for the strategic bitcoin reserve — and then, for maximum confusion, walked back his words a few hours later. 
Allegedly, Cathie Wood’s Ark 21Shares sold bitcoin recently.
Macro: speculation about Fed lowering rates in September (or holding them steady).
The stocks of bitcoin treasury companies, including and especially Strategy, fell like crazy this week too… with suspiciously little activity.

2025-08-20,"From The Bitcoin Jungle To The Sea, Let Lightning Be Free! - Bitcoin Magazine",Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQOGV2ZHBpY0VnaHc5YU9kcHJSbnRTMGtPeVZ2bzRkQ0dCakg3SnBITXRwMnZzd3F4SHFVa3pkWGQxRHRPTHh0RVU2MGJjR085SkRMb1MxaVNGQ0dub1U0NWQzTEFldk5FWFJPNXR2SXN1U3UtZDdVbDNIdzR5dVJYcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Welcome to the jungle — the Bitcoin Jungle.

Bitcoin Jungle is a bitcoin circular economy located in the Puntarenas province of Uvita, Costa Rica, where over 600 merchants accept bitcoin. It’s also the place Francis Pouliot has called home for the past three years.

And the Canadian expat and founder of Bull Bitcoin wants other Bitcoiner expats who visit the region, and Costa Rica at large, to feel how he feels in the country — welcomed.

For this reason, he and the team at Bull Bitcoin created a web app that works both within the Bitcoin Jungle wallet, an open source, custodial Lightning wallet, and in conjunction with other Lightning wallets.

Through the web app interface, Bitcoin enthusiasts can pay for almost anything with bitcoin over Lightning, regardless of whether the merchant or counterparty with whom they’re transacting accepts it.

Using the Bitcoin Jungle app or the web app directly, users can pay with bitcoin and have their bill settled in the local fiat currency, colónes, over the country’s national electronic payment system, SINPE (Sistema Nacional de Pagos Electrónicos). (This is comparable to how Strike, Bringin, and Bull Bitcoin enables users to pay with bitcoin over Lightning to settle fiat bills via the United States’ ACH system, Europe’s SEPA system, and Canada’s Interac system, respectively.)

With more than 90% of the country’s residents over the age of 18 using SINPE for daily payments, the Bull Bitcoin app makes it very easy for nonresidents of Costa Rica to participate in the country’s digital economy (you must be a resident of the country to open a SINPE account) and/or for those who want to live on a bitcoin standard.

“This allows people to live exclusively off of bitcoin,” Pouliot told Bitcoin Magazine. “Every merchant that accepts fiat payments over SINPE in Costa Rica can now accept payments from a Bitcoiner.”

How the Bull Bitcoin Costa Rica Web App Works
When users use the Bull Bitcoin web app in Costa Rica, they make a payment to a Bull Bitcoin Lightning node on the backend. Once Bull Bitcoin receives this payment, it makes a fiat payment via SINPE on the user’s behalf.

Bull Bitcoin processes hundreds of such payments daily in Costa Rica. From May 2024 to May 2025, Bull Bitcoin processed 32,774 bitcoin-to-fiat conversions.

Pouliot prides himself on making sure the Bull Bitcoin web app is as dependable as a credit card, because he knows that many in the country, himself included, depend on it day in and day out.

“If you’re at the gas station in Costa Rica and you don’t have a credit card and you just filled up your car, you need that Lightning-to-SINPE payment to work because otherwise you’re screwed,” explained Pouliot.

“This is how a lot of us live here. We don’t use credit cards. We don’t have cash. So, if I go to the gas station, this app better fucking work. Otherwise, I just filled up my car and I have a very angry gas station attendant,” he added.

“The success rate is well over 99% — almost 100%. I don’t even remember any Lightning payments failing. And that’s because the Bull Bitcoin is managed by hardcore Bitcoiners that know how to navigate Lightning Network liquidity.”

Pouliot added that the hardest part of keeping the app functioning properly isn’t running the Lightning node or plugging in the banking API, though. Instead, he said the biggest challenge is sourcing the fiat liquidity in a not-so-widely-accepted fiat currency like the colón.

“There is no international open marketplace for very low-liquidity fiat currencies and bitcoin,” explained Pouliot.

“Neither Kraken nor Binance or Coinbase list the colón — there’s no bitcoin-to-colónes order book. We need to sell that bitcoin to someone else to get the fiat in order to pay out the fiat merchant,” he added.

Pouliot explained that, because major bitcoin and crypto exchanges don’t list the colón, he essentially sets the exchange rate for it by constructing what he calls a “virtual bitcoin-to-colón exchange rate.” To calculate this rate, Pouliot factors in the colón-to-U.S. dollar rate and the USD-to-bitcoin rate and then adds a 1% gross margin rate to help Bull Bitcoin not lose money on the exchange rate while still keeping the product accessible to users.

He stressed that maintaining liquidity is truly the biggest challenge in this process, and he tipped his hat to others around the world who offer a similar service with a comparable degree of reliability.

“Whenever you see a group of people that have achieved this seamless flow, know that while it sounds so simple, it can be very complicated on the back end”, said Pouliot. “That’s why, for example, I find Tando so impressive.”

Kenya’s Tando
Kenya’s version of the Bull Bitcoin app isn’t a web app, but a proper app, though the team behind Tando was influenced by what Bull Bitcoin has done in Costa Rica.

“The Bitcoin Jungle team posted a video on their X where they went into a gas station and spent bitcoin while the merchant received the local currency,” Jason, one of Tando’s cofounders, told Bitcoin Magazine. 

“I was like, ‘That’s pretty cool.’ We thought that would probably work here if Safaricom [a Kenyan mobile network operator] has an API,” he added.

“And with just a little research, we figured out that ‘Yeah, we can do this.’”

Jason and his co-founder, Sabina Waithira, launched the app in July 2024, enabling Kenyan users to settle bills in Kenyan shillings over M-PESA (Safaricom helped launch M-PESA), a mobile money system that operates in more than a half dozen African countries, while paying with bitcoin over Lightning.

Using Tando, users can pay bills, buy goods, and send Kenyan shillings with nothing more than a recipient’s phone number and a Lightning wallet. (M-PESA only requires a recipient’s phone number for money transfers.)

The user sends bitcoin from the Lightning wallet of their choosing, Tando’s Lightning node receives the bitcoin, and Tando settles the fiat M-PESA bill for the sender.

All of this happens within seconds.

I know firsthand because I used Tando while I was in Kenya for the African Bitcoin Conference in 2024.

While in Kenya, I paid taxi fares and restaurant bills over M-PESA using Tando, something I otherwise wouldn’t have been able to do, since I wasn’t in the country long enough to get an M-PESA account and fund it with Kenyan shillings. As a short-term visitor, it was much easier to spend bitcoin into the local economy with Tando, which doesn’t require a sign-up process.

Making Bitcoin Easier To Spend For Kenyans
Waithira wasn’t familiar with what was happening with Lightning-to-fiat payments in Costa Rica before Jason brought it to her attention.

What motivated her to bring Tando to life was instead her own experience of trying to spend bitcoin in Kenya.

“I used to work for Bitcoin Dada [a virtual Bitcoin education platform and sisterhood for African women] and would sometimes get paid in bitcoin”, Waithira told Bitcoin Magazine. “It was hard to spend that Bitcoin directly.”

While Waithira came up with creative ways to spend her bitcoin, like tipping waiters and waitresses at restaurants with it, she ended up facing the same question from those service workers time and time again: “How can I spend this bitcoin?”

“We didn’t have a great answer to this question”, said Waithira. “So, this is also what inspired Tando.”

Waithira added that “Kenyans are very fast learners and very curious”, which makes it easy to onboard them to Bitcoin and Tando, while Jason shared that Kenyans have been primed for Bitcoin, as they’ve already gone through the mobile money revolution with M-PESA over the past decade and a half.

Waithira also noted that she and Jason have aimed to make Tando as easy to use as M-PESA is — to not scare users off with a complicated interface.

“We wanted to mimic the experience of using M-Pesa”, explained Waithira.

“I don’t like thinking when I use apps, and I don’t think our customers do either”, she added. “We kept this in mind as we designed Tando.”

Waithira and Jason apparently did something right, as Tando has been gaining traction with everyday Kenyans slowly and steadily. It now processes over 100 transactions per day.

And beyond just helping more Kenyans live on a bitcoin standard, the app inspired a developer on the other side of the African continent to create something similar for the citizens of his home country, Ghana.

Ghana’s BitSpenda
Bright Kportiklah also attended the 2024 African Bitcoin Conference and was one of many attendees who used Tando while in Kenya.

Drawing from the inspiration he felt in Kenya as well as the connections he made at the conference, the computer programmer headed back to Ghana after the conference with the intention of building his own version of Tando.

Within a few months, Kportiklah had the beta version of a Lightning-to-fiat interface he’d created — BitSpenda — up and running. And he did this thanks in part to help from seasoned Nigerian Bitcoin entrepreneur Bernard Parah, founder and CEO of Bitnob, whom Kportiklah had met at the conference.

Bitnob is an almost decade-old financial services company that leverages payment infrastructure built on Bitcoin and Lightning. Parah and the team at Bitnob helped Kportiklah connect to local off-ramps in Africa, including mobile money networks in Ghana and Kenya and bank accounts in Nigeria. (BitSpenda currently serves the citizens of these three countries.)

“It’s very difficult to connect to these local off-ramps via API as a small fintech,” Kportiklah told Bitcoin Magazine.

“When I told Bernard at the conference that I wanted to build something similar to Tando, he gave me a contact to reach out to in Ghana,” he added.

This contact helped Kportiklah connect BitSpenda to Ghana’s mobile money system.

Kportiklah also added that Kgothatso Ngako, the founder of Machankura (which allows users to send bitcoin over Lightning using a feature phone), and Onionsman of Bitpension (a bitcoin pension account platform based in Nigeria) have also advised him on the project.

“I met all these people at the conference in Kenya, and they have been so instrumental in helping me build this,” Kportiklah said.

BitSpenda went live on March 7 this year.

To use the web app, senders can look up the recipients they want to send money to by phone number in Ghana and Kenya and by bank account number in Nigeria.

Once the sender has found the recipient they are looking for and decides to make a payment, a Lightning invoice or QR code is generated, and, almost instantly, the bitcoin the user sends is converted into the recipient’s local currency and the transaction is settled.

“Within 30 seconds, the recipient will receive the money, and the sender can see on BitSpenda whether the money was received or not,” explained Kportiklah.

If a transaction fails, as has only happened in less than 1% of transaction attempts thus far, Kportiklah can manually send the payment to the recipient and notify the sender that the transaction has gone through.

As of late April 2025, the app had processed thousands of U.S. dollars’ worth of transactions. Kportiklah claimed that the app has encouraged more Ghanaians to use bitcoin not just because they feel that bitcoin is a better money than Ghanaian cedis, the country’s fiat currency, but for another important reason, as well.

“Ghanaians are more willing to use Bitcoin because of the value it offers in terms of finance,” explained Kportiklah.

“For example, in Ghana, if you keep your money in your bank accounts, at the end of the month, the bank will charge fees, but this isn’t the case when people use bitcoin instead of their bank,” he added.

“Some people also just see bitcoin as a currency that has more value as compared to the Ghanaian cedi and choose to use it for that reason.”

Kportiklah also noted that an app like BitSpenda is particularly helpful in Ghana, where outside of the Bitcoin circular economy that Kportiklah serves as the technical advisor for — Bitcoin Dua — almost no merchants accept bitcoin.

And he aspires to not only offer this service to Ghanaians, but to Africans in over a dozen countries.

“A year from now, we should be in no less than 15 African countries”, said Kportiklah.

It’s hard to doubt he’ll accomplish this when, in under four months, he was able to roll out BitSpenda in three countries.

Kportiklah said he’s currently completing the necessary paperwork to make BitSpenda available to members of the remaining 12 countries he wishes to service.

He’ll have to hurry, though, given that the team from Tando is looking to expand into Uganda soon and that a new web app built by a Senegalese developer — Banxaas — now enables bitcoin-to-fiat payments in Senegal, as well.

A Labor Of Love
The irony in what Pouliot, Waithira, Jason and Kportiklah have created is that they’re less motivated by making money than they are by making bitcoin money.

“This is not a profitable endeavor”, deadpanned Pouliot about Bull’s Bitcoin Costa Rica web app.

“Actually, this has a very high cost for us — it’s very complicated and there’s a lot of overhead. So, it’s done with the mindset of ‘Sure, maybe one day it’s going to be profitable,’ but we do this more to be part of the Bitcoin Jungle mission of maintaining infrastructure to facilitate Lightning”, he added. 

“Not to say that it will never be a profitable business. I actually encourage people to consider that to be a potentially profitable business. But at scale, it’s really hard to pull off.”

Neither the founders of Tando nor Kportiklah have figured out a monetization scheme yet.

“Our business model is we get bitcoin”, said Jason half-jokingly.

He added that he and Waithira have fielded a number of requests for other wallets who want to use their Safaricom API, and that they’re considering charging a fee for these other wallets to do so. This doesn’t seem to be as much of a priority for them as getting Kenyans to view bitcoin as a medium of exchange, though.

Kportiklah is of the same mind:

“The goal for now is just to create a tool that will help people to spend Bitcoin with ease”, he said.

Toward the end of my interview with Pouliot, he highlighted once more how important it is to keep in mind that it takes a lot of work from dedicated Bitcoiners to pull off the “with ease” part, noting that initiatives like these are best created and managed at the local level by those who have a solid understanding of the traditional financial system with which they’re interfacing.

“These products are better built as grassroots projects, because they require knowledge of the banking system on the ground”, explained Pouliot.

“This is why we don’t have that many expansion plans, but I’m happy to support the other local initiatives with technology and advice”, he added before noting that he thinks what NostrPIX, another Lightning-to-fiat payment app, is doing in Brazil is cool.

He concluded by once more offering praise for his colleagues around the world who are successfully building and managing such interfaces:

“Whenever you see a local group of Bitcoiners pulling it off, be sure that they are fucking awesome and that it wasn’t easy to do.”"

This is probably one of the most frequently uttered sentences in this ecosystem when it comes to discussing Bitcoin self custody practices.

Wrong. 

This fallacious framing and line of argumentation is no different than saying “shooting a gun is just pointing and pulling a trigger, anyone can do it.” There is so much more than just pointing and pulling a trigger to shooting a gun safely. To start, there is actually having the appreciation for what a gun is, and the consequences using one can have. Consequences you cannot take back. 

A gun is not a toy, it is a tool that can kill people. Without truly appreciating that, people can be careless in handling a gun, and if they were to cause harm to someone else while being careless there is no undo button. 

There is no way to wind back time and bring someone back from the dead, just like there is no way to rewinding a bitcoin transaction. 

Writing down 12 words doesn’t just solve everything. First users have to actually appreciate what those 12 words are. They have to really understand that those 12 words are their money. That they must be kept secret and secure in order to safeguard their bitcoin. Just having those 12 words written down doesn’t equate to having that appreciation. 

Next, they need to actually physically secure that copy of 12 words to keep it secret. 

Can they actually physically secure that mnemonic seed anywhere? Do they own a safe? Do they live with other people? Is there a spouse or children to consider? Does living with them mean that other people will be in your residence? Are they trustworthy? 

What about con artists, hackers and social engineers? Is someone aware enough to discern when they are interacting with one of them? Do they understand the lines malicious actors are trying to cross in terms of access to their keys? Do they know how to verify software they download from outside of an App Store? Are they even observant enough to detect the signs that software in the App Store is fraudulent and malicious?

What about long-term compatibility? Does a certain device or piece of software do anything non-standard? Weird derivation paths? Custom backup schemes? Do users even understand these things to deal with them, or will this inevitably, in the long run, force them to trust a third party who could defraud them to deal with their wallet or backup not working with modern solutions in, say, ten years?

That’s not even touching on hardware devices. Can someone verify a device’s integrity? Hell, let’s go back before that: Can most people even assess whether a hardware device’s architecture and the company producing it are reputable? 

I am not saying any of this to scare people away from self custody, or to be defeatist. This is a reality check. Bitcoin needs people to self-custody their funds and use them directly to remain decentralized in the long term. People will not do that if it is a terrifying, dangerous and unfamiliar experience. 

It’s that simple. Just telling people over and over again to not fuck up won’t magically stop them from fucking up. Telling people over and over again to not be scared and anxious won’t magically make them stop being scared and anxious. Pretending that very real technical footguns don’t exist because they are trivial for you or I to deal with doesn’t make them stop existing for normal people. 

We have a lot of tools to deal with these problems. Multisignature schemes allow key rotation and the potential to have a helping hand to fix mistakes. Schnorr multisignature schemes optimize this even further, creating less extra complexity for users. Both types of multisignature scripts can benefit from other improvements to create privacy. 

How user interfaces are designed can do a lot to deal with scammers. The architecture different wallets or devices use can potentially remove attack surfaces entirely, or make them irrelevant if only exploited with one device or piece of software. 

To this day, ten years or more after I used a Bitcoin multisignature wallet for the first time, it is still unintuitive, obnoxious and sometimes not possible to create a multisignature wallet using multiple independent pieces of software. 

If we want people to actually self-custody at scale, which is necessary for Bitcoin itself to maintain real decentralization, these issues need to be addressed. Things need to actually be intuitive. Things need to be compatible across vendors and software. Users actually need something analogous to the helping hand they are used to with fiat money services. 

If these things do not change, if they are not built and smoothed out, if compatibility doesn’t improve, then people just won’t self-custody their funds.

These things need to be experimented with, tested and refined, and ultimately cater to what your average person actually needs to not only feel safe with self custody, but to actually be safe. 

If it doesn’t feel safe to them, people just won’t do it."

Maria - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE53SnRqb1NDMjV6bmpSTldodDI3ZVFfZ3FnSWdlcXBBa1FKdW9KN2FYRVlTRGVOMUJDWnNjSjlDR091cElROEJFX3BYc01OcjU4UGl4YTRfSjJCZWswMU4yWTUtRXp4LWV3dUxPRw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We are living through the change of an era, where the old one is still dying and the new one is still being born. We are living through the end of the industrial era, when prosperity came mainly from factories and the cities that fed them with workers. States played an essential role there, providing access to raw materials for the factories, guaranteeing trade routes and infrastructure for their goods and keeping the workers’ movement in check. In return, the factories, thanks to their scale of production, supplied the markets and could afford to pay the states their dues in the form of taxes.

We are now in the middle of the transition to the information age, where scale no longer rules, but personalization. Thanks to the internet, we can aggregate demand and connect with a tailor-made offer, which allows us to produce or provide very specific services and add value in an innovative way. It is no longer necessary to produce to scale to fill the big car showcases; now you order the car the way you want it on a website. Customization is reshaping economic relations, and with it, the world.

With the success of the industrial era, large financial centers were developed, and the regions of the world that were left out of these processes were literally abandoned, cut off from the world’s value chains, unbanked and without access to products and services. But thanks to the internet, more and more regions are emerging from this isolation, and thanks to bitcoin they are also beginning to surface from this economic-financial disconnection.

Many of these regions used to live on remittances sent by their relatives from abroad, with which intermediaries made a great business from the lack of alternatives. Without investment, without capital, without effective quality property, without connection to global value chains, without the possibility of industrialization, these regions were condemned to poverty and marginalization.

Since Bitcoin, together with the internet, more than 1.8 billion people have been able to join the global value chains for the first time, in an era in which personalization and authenticity are precisely what bring the most value. The state as an institution begins to fade away and takes a backseat; meanwhile, the local connects with the global, highlighting its authenticity and personality.

Bitcoin and the internet allow anyone with access to a cell phone to join that global conversation of bits, showcase themselves in the world’s storefront and join value chains around the globe.

In this new era, communities that had been isolated in the industrial era are being reborn: They can now provide services, they can show the world what they are, what they do, and participate in the value creation of trade. The personality of the local attracts the curious and adventurous ones. Personalized communities that are developing as Bitcoin Circular Economies are the best example of this and serve as the seed of the future.

The Role of Bitcoin
Bitcoin is much better understood when we think of it as a global immutable system of absolute property rights — with an underlying real asset that closely resembles a kind of digital gold. When we look at it this way, we realize that private property rights have been instituted worldwide and anyone can own and transmit value without anyone else being able to stop or prevent it — even, with the right measures, not even know about it. This does not only affect payments, but also remittances, donations, savings, inheritance and guarantee contracts. At a stroke, Bitcoin, by introducing a new domain that crosses and covers all the borders of the world (cyberspace), establishes an effective ownership without limits or restrictions. This necessarily leads to the emergence of new ways of relating economically and exchanging value. The connection of the local with the global occurs precisely there: The nexus of local communities with the internet and Bitcoin has no limits. Donations, remittances, ways of providing services around the world, even teleworking, ways of hosting citizens — even granting residence permits in exchange for deposits in multi-signature accounts.

There is a whole world to be explored that will be built on Bitcoin and the local!

Bitcoin Circular Economies demonstrate precisely this: How Bitcoin, despite being global, does not go with globalism, but with connecting the local and the global. Its personality, as opposed to the impersonal and homogenizing of states, conquers the new domain of cyberspace. In these stories of Bitcoin Circular Economies we see precisely the foundations of the future. The birth of millions of people who can incorporate and provide services to the whole world, welcome tourists and other types of visitors to enjoy their communities and learn to live like them. To begin to live those lifestyles outside the unbridled world of the industrial and financial era.

Bitcoin Circular Economies: The Future
These initiatives are gaining weight and popularity, and new ways of living will emerge in different states. As these communities grow, they will also have to evolve into political communities. And it is critical that this vision be adopted by them. The move toward becoming personalized jurisdictions will give them an immense qualitative leap to bring value to the world in a unique way. That will be the guarantee to maintain their authenticity and lifestyle.

States are the first ones that should be interested in promoting this type of initiative, because just as it was important in the 20th century to be a productive power, today it’s important to be able to attract talent by offering a friendly jurisdiction and a better lifestyle than the one offered by today’s world. Education will play a fundamental role in this whole process, as it will sow the soil and fertilize it so that it can prosper. The influence of these communities in the different countries will be of great benefit to all — as reflected in the relationship between El Zonte and El Salvador, which has borne so much fruit for the country.

The big mistake to avoid is to see Bitcoin as the foundation of these communities. Bitcoin is the tool, not the foundation. Just as gunpowder made us stop living in walled cities, but did not build gunpowder-cities, neither should we make that mistake with Bitcoin. The foundation of these new communities must be authenticity and the relentless pursuit of being better.

Undoubtedly, the emergence of Bitcoin Circular Economies is a very important step in the right direction. They move toward personalized jurisdictions that are able to connect the local with the global, not only in an economic way, but in a political way. That is the great challenge of the future. I am convinced that these stories will inspire the world. Bitcoin is the hope and the cornerstone to build a new world — a world that is already beginning to dawn.

2025-08-15,Is Bitcoin Price Outperforming Gold And NASDAQ This Cycle? - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE0xNDVWYTZwMlpCNVg0cmdndzVscjA3ZDA1TW13Q21GdlVBT05fSHZyUEZQVF9Hd05oWEFKUjFnY21YMWl1c1BKbXZURXdoTDhKWkNNM1MtMkhUOWhZMU9mVUNwLXQ5dURLQTJEbDBYRm81ZUU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The bitcoin price currently appears to be on the verge of entering a euphoric phase of price action after an already strong bull market. However, has this cycle truly been as impressive as the USD price chart suggests, or could Bitcoin actually be underperforming when compared to other assets and historical cycles? This analysis digs into the numbers, compares multiple cycles, and examines Bitcoin’s performance not just against the US dollar, but also versus assets like Gold and US tech stocks, to give a clearer picture of where we really stand.

Previous Bitcoin Price Cycles
Looking at the Bitcoin Growth Since Cycle Lows chart, the data initially looks promising. From the lows at the tail end of the last bear market, Bitcoin has delivered returns of around 634% at the time of writing. These are significant gains, supported not only by price action but also by strong fundamentals. Institutional accumulation via ETFs and Bitcoin treasury holdings has been robust, and on-chain data shows a large proportion of long-term holders refusing to take profits. Historically, this is the kind of backdrop that precedes a strong run-up phase late in the bull cycle, similar to what we saw in prior cycles.

Current Bitcoin Price Cycle
Turning to the USD price chart on TradingView, the current bitcoin price cycle does not look bad at all, especially in terms of stability. The deepest retracement this cycle has been around 32%, which occurred after surpassing $100,000 and pulling back to roughly $74,000–$75,000. This is far milder than the 50% or greater drawdowns seen in past cycles. Reduced volatility could mean reduced upside potential, but it also makes the market less treacherous for investors. The price structure has followed a “step-up” pattern, sharp rallies followed by choppy consolidation, then another rally, repeatedly pushing toward new all-time highs. From a fundamental standpoint, the market remains strong.

Bitcoin Price vs Other Assets
When measuring Bitcoin against something more stable than the US dollar, such as the NASDAQ or other US tech stocks, a different picture emerges. US tech stocks are also high-growth, speculative assets, so this comparison is a more direct comparison than BTC vs USD. Here, Bitcoin’s performance looks less spectacular. In this current cycle, the climb beyond the previous high has been minimal. However, the chart shows Bitcoin currently turning prior resistance into support, which may set the foundation for a more sustained move higher. What we can also see, looking at the previous double-top cycle, is a second peak at a considerably lower level, suggesting that Bitcoin’s second peak in the last cycle may have been driven more by global liquidity expansion and fiat currency debasement than by genuine outperformance.

The “digital gold” narrative invites another important comparison, looking at BTC vs Gold. Bitcoin has still not surpassed its previous all-time high from the 2021 peak when measured in Gold. That means an investor who bought BTC at the 2021 peak and held until now would have underperformed compared to simply holding Gold. Since the last cycle lows, Bitcoin vs Gold has returned over 300%, but Gold itself has been in a powerful bull run. Measuring in Gold terms strips away fiat debasement effects and shows the “true” purchasing power of BTC.

True Purchasing Power
To take this a step further, adjusting the Bitcoin vs Gold chart for Global M2 money supply expansion paints an even more sobering picture. When accounting for the huge liquidity injections into the global economy in recent years, Bitcoin’s cycle peak price in “liquidity-adjusted Gold” terms is still below the prior peak. This helps explain the lack of retail excitement, as there’s no new high in real purchasing power terms.

Conclusion
So far, Bitcoin’s bull market has been impressive in dollar terms, with over 600% gains from the lows and a relatively low-volatility climb. Yet, when measured against assets like US tech stocks or Gold, and especially when adjusted for Global Liquidity expansion, the performance is far less extraordinary. The data suggests much of this cycle’s rally may have been fueled by fiat debasement rather than pure outperformance. While there’s still room for significant upside, especially if Bitcoin can break through the liquidity-adjusted resistance and push to even higher highs, investors should also pay close attention to these ratio charts. They offer a clearer perspective on relative performance and could provide valuable clues about where the bitcoin price might go next."
2025-08-13,Trump Admin Silent As Tornado Cash Verdict Threatens Bitcoin Privacy - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE8xalpOc0I2ZkJxQjhEcGMtYk5QNmgtVHc4ZlJ2bGNDaVhVeFhELUE2cWRMM2NjSkVJU2JCRXFiUG9nR2N0YVpmbk8zLWJRRFBxd0t3MDBoYnljLVVENmNGUnRoVWFRMlVNbGxpWWtLNy1FOVVfaFg2bmZ3Qy1Ldw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Major developments in both the Tornado Cash and Samourai Wallet trials that took place earlier this month may set dangerous precedents for the Bitcoin and crypto industry as a whole. The two defendants who developed Samourai Wallet, a popular Bitcoin privacy app, made a plea deal accepting the charges of being an unlicensed money services business, while Roman Storm, developer of Tornado Cash, an Ethereum smart contract that also unlocked financial privacy for its users, was found guilty on one of three charges — that of being an unlicensed money services business.

The irony? Both of these companies were started after FINCEN, the U.S. institution that regulates money transmitters, had given clear guidance that services that did not control user funds were not subject to the regulations. Neither Samourai Wallet nor Tornado Cash had control over user funds. They both functioned as noncustodial technologies — protocols by which users could interact, never trusting the developers with the bitcoin or ether being transferred.

This is akin to a VPN (virtual private network) used regularly by millions of people to protect their basic user data and privacy from hackers and third parties on the internet, being found guilty of operating a radio station. Yeah, it makes no sense.

The DOJ’s Sovereign Southern District of New York went ahead with the charges anyway, despite having clarity on the guidance as revealed by Roman Storm’s defense lawyers during the Tornado Cash trial.

The verdicts were mixed and while the industry has expressed some relief over the results (since the worst fears about these trials threatened to land all developers involved in prison for decades), the five or so years that seem to be expected in sentencing for the defendants are nevertheless impactful. The legal ramifications to other developers throughout the computer science world, not just crypto, are yet to be understood or fleshed out.

If Roman can be found guilty of the behavior of users of his smart contract app — which he had no capacity to shut down or impose a fundamental filter on — then what liability are normal software developers now exposed to?

Most odd of all has been the silence from the Trump administration, Trump who explicitly campaigned on protecting self custody and setting the table for the United States to be the crypto capital of the world. How do they expect that to happen now? Why did they not do more to stop this government overreach initiated by Biden’s DOJ? Is the DOJ not politically in control of the SDNY?

The one thing the administration did do, however, was publish the The White House Digital Assets Report, a blueprint from President Trump’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. It outlines over 100 legislative and regulatory recommendations to “foster blockchain innovation in the United States.”

The one subtle pearl of hope that week was that the document quoted Satoshi Nakamoto as the creator of Bitcoin extensively, and is said by experts to lay the groundwork for the passing of the CLARITY Act. This act has most recently included language that protects self custody and privacy-preserving technology in crypto at a legislative level.

It would be a big relief to the industry to get a more explicit statement from the Trump administration, as software developers across the industry should start to consider their options — including, probably, getting a solid lawyer until the legal dust settles. "
2025-08-12,How Companies Are Adding Bitcoin Art To Their Corporate Collections - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBiNXVOaVBpdHBxczZpWXFUZXczWmZWcmk2ZmhleXlhNGRYblFoVFcyanpqZTdFU2xIMmJvbktuNVdzRUJEemg2YkZ2d0twa3V3eUl0anlzakpKYTA5ajh2NkxVNXZkRTI0WDRFUkVkT0FmaG9SSWhYX3lsR3BCZnM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bitcoin art and Bitcoin corporations don’t seem to mix. But for decades — indeed centuries — companies have collected art to express their role in society. As early as the 15th century, the Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (1472) established one of the first corporate art collections. What began merely as decorative embellishment quickly evolved into a status symbol and a sign of wealth, success and cultural responsibility. Can Bitcoin-native companies gain strategic advantages through digital art? And what role does Bitcoin art play as a new asset class and cultural anchor?

Why Do Companies Collect Art? 
Paintings, sculptures and installations now hang in corporate headquarters worldwide, not just to beautify walls but as statements: Art signals cultural capital and underscores a firm’s identity and values. With the rise of the digital economy, especially Bitcoin, the question arises how this tradition can continue in the 21st century. 

Corporate art collections are now a fixed part of corporate culture. By the mid-2010s there were already more than 2,000 major corporate collections in North America and beyond, together worth billions. The motivations are diverse: Surprisingly, immediate financial gain is not the main driver; the tax deduction isn’t what’s motivating companies. Rather, art engagement helps firms advance strategic goals, reach new client groups, strengthen employee loyalty and enrich the quality of life around the company. In other words, art in business creates cultural capital — the value that French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu defined as the sum of cultural knowledge and prestige.

Companies that collect art therefore pursue image building and cultural promotion simultaneously. Historically, a clear pattern emerges: In the prosperous 1950s, many U.S. corporations began collecting art to make cultural statements on their newly built campuses and to support the community. The movement peaked in the 1980s, then cooled when other forms of corporate philanthropy (education, social causes) came to the fore. Yet companies that kept buying art did so under stricter criteria and with a clear purpose.

Strategic Leveraging of Art: Cultural Capital and Brand Identity
Corporate art collections fulfill several roles at once. Internally, they create inspiring environments that foster creativity and identification; externally, they serve as reputational tools: Art signals education, stability and community spirit, and art collections have long since become part of brand identity. 

The best examples show that the goal is not ostentation but social value: Deutsche Bank, for instance, founded its collection in 1980 expressly to support emerging German artists. Today, it holds tens of thousands of works of international art and even operates its own museum in Berlin (the PalaisPopulaire) to stage public exhibitions. Here, art builds bridges between the company and society. JPMorgan Chase has pursued a similar concept for decades: Its “Art at Work” program, initiated in 1959 by David Rockefeller, focused deliberately on emerging and overlooked artists worldwide — an unusual approach but one that truly fosters art. Such collections are proactively built and make art central to corporate DNA rather than using it merely as decoration.

A strategically managed collection becomes a lever for cultural capital. By choosing art (including Bitcoin art) that fits the company’s philosophy, a firm can subtly communicate its values: innovation, internationality or reverence for tradition. UBS began building its corporate collection in the early 1970s as part of a commitment to cultural engagement, focusing from the outset on both established and emerging artists from across the globe. The UBS collection, for example, reflects the bank’s global reach by acquiring art from every region where it operates, including new markets such as Thailand or Korea. Guided by independent curators and an international advisory board, UBS has created a collection that represents the diversity of its communities while spotlighting young, emerging artists. 

Economists see such investments as akin to other intangible assets: They raise brand value through cultural legitimacy and recognition. Firms are the new patrons: Bank collections, for instance, have gone beyond their original marketing function and now act as “new Medici”-patrons, on par with Renaissance families who once supported the arts. Especially as public cultural budgets shrink, this private patronage is more important than ever. Properly managed, corporate collections thus serve not only the firm but society at large, filling gaps left by underfunded public museums. They are, correctly used, a cultural asset for the public.

Change in the Last Ten Years: From Contemporary Art to Bitcoin Art
Recently, corporate collections have evolved mainly in content. Contemporary works — painting, sculpture, photography — still dominate, but digital art forms are increasingly gaining ground. Digital art has existed since the 1960s (from early computer-plotter drawings to video art), and collections like JPMorgan’s integrated video and media art decades ago. In the 2010s, however, blockchain technology sparked a revolution: NFTs (non-fungible tokens) made it possible to attach proof of ownership to digital artworks and trade them. Progressive companies, especially in tech, began to include digital works in their collections or even build their own NFT portfolios to underscore an innovative image.

The development, however, was not linear. The NFT boom of 2021 — fueled by spectacular auctions such as Beeple’s “Everydays” for USD 69 million — led to exuberance; many collectors, including corporations, bought digital art at peak hype. Disillusion soon followed: Since its 2021 peak, the NFT art market has collapsed by over 90 percent, from USD 2.9 billion annual turnover in 2021 to roughly USD 24 million in the first quarter of 2025. This drastic correction is reflected in the caution of established collectors. According to an Art Basel/UBS survey, the share of digital art in high-net-worth collections fell in parallel. In short, after the hype came the reality check, and companies that jumped too quickly onto the NFT bandwagon hit the brakes as the speculative bubbles burst.

This should be viewed not as an end, but as maturation. What remains is a core of serious actors and institutions that believe in the long-term potential of digital art and now collect more selectively. For corporate collections, this means digital art can now be integrated with greater prudence — not as a short-term PR stunt but as a substantive addition. Firms should focus on digital art of clear artistic quality and historical context rather than chasing every trendy NFT. New presentation formats, such as company galleries or online platforms, are being tested. The past decade has thus seen art and tech converge, with corporate collections gradually learning to view digital art as part of their concepts.

Digital Art From a Bitcoin Perspective: Status Quo and Future in Collections
Within Bitcoin, digital art opens a special chapter. For years, the NFT market played out mainly on Ethereum and other smart-contract platforms, whereas Bitcoin — conceived chiefly as a monetary system — was culturally represented more by physical objects (Casascius coins, sculptures or paintings with Bitcoin themes) and meme culture (e.g., Pepe). Yet Bitcoin-centric art projects actually predate the NFT hype: Experimental works began appearing on the Bitcoin-fork Namecoin as early as 2012, and the Colored Coins initiative in 2013 offered another way to encode and transfer digital assets on-chain. The launch of the Counterparty protocol (2014) accelerated things, with the first Counterparty-minted artworks emerging; most famous are the Rare Pepe trading cards (2016), now regarded as pioneers of crypto-art. Native experiments directly on Bitcoin Layer 1 also surfaced around 2015, but Bitcoin only captured broad public attention as a medium for digital art after the 2023 Ordinals boom. For corporate collections, this signals that Bitcoin-based digital art has deep historical roots, is clearly on the rise, and can hardly be ignored by anyone wishing to stay current.

From a Bitcoin-only perspective, digital art is viewed not merely as an asset but as a cultural expression of the ecosystem. Often described as a socioeconomic movement, Bitcoin carries its own aesthetics and ideology (decentralization, censorship resistance, HODL mentality, etc.). These values are reflected in artworks — from blockchain data visualisations to portraits of Satoshi Nakamoto to meme-infused creations. Such Bitcoin-native works could become iconic cultural goods, comparable to corporate art of earlier eras — think industrial paintings of the 19th century or propaganda art of the early modern age that accompanied economic upheavals. For current collections this means adopting Bitcoin art now is not just acquiring any digital art but a piece of financial and tech history. The 2020s are writing the artistic narrative of cryptocurrency companies. By collecting emerging and historical Bitcoin art, they can become part of that narrative and help shape it.

Why Bitcoin-Native Firms Should Collect Art and Bitcoin Art
Given these developments, why should Bitcoin companies collect art now? The answer mixes reputation, identity and responsibility. A collection can certainly burnish the image of Bitcoin firms, showing openness to culture and reducing perceptions that they are mere tech or finance nerds. More important is their active contribution to cultural formation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin is more than a protocol; it is a social movement with its own conferences, memes and a global community. Culture is the glue that holds such movements together. If companies like Nakamoto, Strategy or Metaplanet build collections, they create identity anchors for the Bitcoin community. A curated Bitcoin art collection can visualise the movement’s values and stories — acting like a visual manifesto.

At the same time, the companies become protagonists of this culture. Just as major banks became “new Medici” through their collections, Bitcoin firms could establish themselves as digital patrons who nurture and shape an emerging art scene. This goes beyond sponsorship: It means taking long-term responsibility for cultural heritage. In the competition for top talent and customers, that can be decisive. I mean, who wouldn’t wish to work for or invest in a company that helps shape culture and history rather than merely chase profit? A well-communicated art initiative can spark loyalty and excitement that no budget could buy, both inside the firm.

There is also an economic network effect: A vibrant cultural environment around Bitcoin increases the entire ecosystem’s appeal. The more art, music, literature and discourse exist about Bitcoin, the more firmly it becomes anchored in society. That can indirectly boost demand (people encounter Bitcoin through art), foster innovation (artists experiment with the technology) and improve public acceptance (it is not just “number go up” but a global cultural phenomenon), ultimately raising network value. Companies collecting and supporting art now invest in Bitcoin’s future viability, yielding long-term commercial benefits. Strategy, as the largest bitcoin treasury company, has an inherent interest in strengthening Bitcoin culturally as well as financially to safeguard the longevity of its holdings. Art can become a soft-power instrument, creating narrative legitimacy for Bitcoin in the broader public.

Measures: Building Museums, Scholarships, Prizes and Archives
What concrete art initiatives could Bitcoin companies pursue? Historical precedents abound.

Some banks and corporations have founded their own museums or art halls (Deutsche Bank’s PalaisPopulaire, Samsung’s Leeum Museum in Seoul). A Bitcoin company could similarly establish a Bitcoin Art Museum to exhibit outstanding works: digital projections, interactive pieces, classical paintings or sculptures with Bitcoin themes. First initiatives already point in this direction. The Bitcoin Museum in Nashville, for example, is a noteworthy early attempt to tell the story of Bitcoin through a mix of artefacts, memorabilia and artworks, to showcase the journey from Cypherpunk beginnings through the Mt. Gox era to the present. Such a museum serves as a cultural meeting point for the community and the public. 

My idea for companies builds on this: to assemble collections that go beyond contemporary Bitcoin artists, tracing the intellectual history of Bitcoin in art since the 1910s. Professionally managed, these collections would be rooted in historical context, adaptable for thematic exhibitions and available for loans to strengthen both the academic recognition and the cultural presence of Bitcoin-related art.

Scholarships and prizes are powerful levers. A firm might offer an annual “Bitcoin Art Scholarship” to support talented young artists engaging with Bitcoin, or a prize for Bitcoin-based digital art (e.g., for the most innovative Ordinals project of the year). Such awards would create instant resonance in the art and crypto scenes, granting recipients greater visibility — think of the Arab Bank Switzerland Digital Art Prize. 

Like major collections of the past that deliberately bought works from then unknown artists, Bitcoin companies should now seek tomorrow’s hidden champions rather than merely chasing volume without cultural value. Supporting the avant-garde of Bitcoin art today could later prove both culturally and financially rewarding: Analysts have remarked that blockchain-based digital art could become the next trillion-dollar asset class, appealing to global collectors and new investor groups.

A frequently overlooked but essential component is building archives and documentation structures. Art is only as valuable as its history is traceable — especially in the digital realm. Companies could therefore invest in archival infrastructure, for example, a database of all known Bitcoin-related artworks, with details on artists, descriptions, on-chain transaction histories and more.

Professional Support: Art Historians, Curators and Museum Practice
Ambitious and worthwhile as these plans are, companies need expertise. Collecting art and especially digital art, is not something to be handled casually by a few economists or IT specialists. Bitcoin firms wishing to invest in culture should involve artworld professionals from the start. This has tradition: the UBS collection, for instance, has been managed by curatorial experts for decades and advised by an international board. These experts know how to build a collection with a coherent narrative, assess quality and ensure proper conservation and presentation.

Digital art brings additional challenges, from questions of digital inventory to modes of display. Here, tapping museum experience pays off: A company might collaborate with media-art specialists who have already curated digital exhibitions. Art historians can bridge “new Bitcoin art” and art history, placing the collection in context. Whether avant-garde art, protest art or digital art since the 1960s, such perspective deepens understanding and helps identify artists likely to remain relevant. Continuous documentation and research further enhance cultural value.

Ethical and legal advice is another aspect. In this field, where sources of wealth are scrutinized, transparency and responsible conduct are vital. Art historians and curators ensure collections are not staged merely as PR but remain credible and respectful toward the art community. Classical corporate collections usually commit to buying art on the primary market directly from artists or galleries, thereby supporting living artists instead of chasing auction trophies. This attitude, away from quick flipping toward sustainable patronage, is advisable for Bitcoin companies. Hiring or consulting curators to design and care for the collection mirrors best practice in corporations that systematically maintain their collections.

Finally, art and culture as investments require long-term thinking. Classical art investments have historically yielded moderate returns of about 6% per year, and experts advise buying art primarily from passion, not for returns alone. The same likely holds for Bitcoin art: Its intangible gains (social influence and cultural heritage) are paramount, though financial appreciation may follow. Professional advice helps balance artistic and financial value. When both align, art collections become precisely the strategic asset that does not appear as a number on the balance sheet yet exerts enormous impact within and beyond the company.

Conclusion: A Bright Future for the Arts
In an era where the distinction between the digital and physical worlds is becoming increasingly blurred, corporate art collections are on the verge of entering a new era. Bitcoin represents not only an economic but also a cultural paradigm shift. Corporate art collections in the age of Bitcoin are more than a continuation of an old tradition with new tools; they are an opportunity to shape an emerging cultural cosmos. Historically, companies collected art to present their face to society, inspire employees and make their values tangible. 

Today, Bitcoin companies can adopt these motives and infuse them with new life: By collecting digital artworks on-chain, they create cultural capital in a language that fits their business DNA. They can leverage this capital strategically to generate network effects. Each supported artist and each donated artwork strengthens the narrative of Bitcoin as not merely technology or investment but a cultural movement.

The next steps for me are clear: art scholarships for emerging Bitcoin artists; dedicated exhibition spaces online and offline; partnerships with museums and art academies; perhaps even a corporate museum. Companies should approach the task with humility and seek professional expertise. Just as a CFO is consulted for investment strategy, a curator should be consulted for art strategy. Equipped in this way, Bitcoin-focused firms could become genuine cultural actors, earning future recognition akin to today’s collections of UBS, Deutsche Bank, or JPMorgan.

The young Bitcoin art scene currently presents a historic opportunity: Its culture is still malleable, the “canvas” largely unpainted. Companies that act now can write cultural history. They will own not only digital masterpieces but also contribute to the identity of a decentralized future. Bitcoin is poised to open a new chapter; art provides the language to tell it. Corporate collections can help shape the canon. This is strategic leveraging in its noblest sense: uniting capital and culture to create something of lasting value for the company, for the community and for the future."
2025-08-11,How Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc Is Reinventing Finance With Bitcoin - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPeWFfSkQ0Z2Q5NU5kb19kMGIzQ3BCWjBsRlk4THNubG4tUlByaGU3MGNFbVRuMUxiMVNDQ2I2TWFTR3ZmX0pIUU5LSzdDVElEaVBrX1RMRFZxQlI1Q0gxQU0wUG56c1pjZHFWU3RrWDJGek9IOXZVNGxCMi1OZ3ZjMkQ4MnFHY2twZ1ZkVUFuOE5TY19Q?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Block, Inc., founded by Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and ex-CEO of Twitter, is a financial technology company with a deepening full-stack connection to the Bitcoin industry through its subsidiaries. Its companies span payments apps and merchant tooling with Bitcoin integration, the development of bitcoin mining hardware, open source software development, a decentralized finance protocol for peer-to-peer markets and even a self-custody hardware wallet. 

Formerly called Square and founded in 2009, the company started integrating Bitcoin into its technology offering as early as 2014 via Cash App — its most famous subsidiary — allowing merchants to accept bitcoin payments through the app. In 2021, Square Inc officially rebranded to Block Inc, doubling down on its commitment to Bitcoin and affirming its vision of the future as one where the Bitcoin Blockchain would play a pivotal role. Square became a subsidiary of Block Inc and now deals primarily with payment terminal technology. Today, Block has 8,584 BTC on its balance sheet valued at almost 1 billion dollars, with an average purchase price of 30,405 dollars per bitcoin. 

Of Block’s subsidiaries and investments, most have explicit connections to Bitcoin or blockchain systems such as Cash App, Bitkey, Proto, Spiral and Tidal. All of them are advancing Bitcoin adoption at various levels of the industry and have growing influence and gratitude from the Bitcoin community. Jack Dorsey has been a leading donor to various Bitcoin nonprofits and community efforts, including OpenSats, which funds open source Bitcoin development and through which a great deal of Nostr — a Bitcoin-native social network protocol — has been bootstrapped.

In an exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Miles Suter, product lead at Block, shared insights into the company’s vision for the future and Bitcoin’s ideal role in it. He said that, “We think Bitcoin achieves its ultimate destiny when it’s being used as everyday money. Just like Satoshi intended. I think that Bitcoin as a global financial infrastructure that everyone can access lets companies like Block operate in a much more global manner. And I think that payments are essential to maintaining the core properties that make Bitcoin unique and ultimately will make it win in the long run.”

Below you’ll find short overviews of some of Block’s Bitcoin-related companies, particularly those serving retail, with exclusive quotes from Suter on how they serve critical roles in the path to hyperbitcoinization. 

Square
Launched in 2009, Square is a point-of-sale (POS) system enabling merchants to accept card payments and manage operations like inventory, payroll and business loans. Serving four million sellers and processing $241 billion annually as of 2024, Square announced that it began rolling out Bitcoin payments for merchants at the Bitcoin Vegas conference in 2025, allowing them to accept bitcoin seamlessly via its POS hardware.

The move marks a major milestone in Bitcoin’s integration with retail payment systems, establishing a missing pillar up until now in the business toolkit needed to really use bitcoin as a medium of exchange. “On the Square side, we have over 4 million merchants in the U.S. with a full suite of point-of-sale, inventory, taxes, reporting, like the best in the business in terms of traditional payments processing. This initiative goes beyond just Bitcoin payments,” said Suter.

With the full-stack accounting integration of Bitcoin, merchants who wanted to accept the digital currency but could not because of a lack of tooling now have the door wide open. But the vision is greater than that. “And we’re going to be offering a full-stack Bitcoin banking suite specifically designed for small businesses,” Suter added, leaning into the growing trend of bitcoin treasury companies and strategies that is dominating Bitcoin news today.

Companies will soon have all the tools to accept bitcoin payments and put them directly into their company treasury rather than instantly sell bitcoin for dollars. If they need liquidity, they are already able to put that bitcoin as collateral and get dollar-denominated loans straight to their bank account via companies like Unchained — though, without a doubt, Block is also moving in that direction for their clients. Suter added that “one thing I love about this full-stack Bitcoin banking suite is that we’re democratizing access to Bitcoin treasury tools that were previously only available to large corporations. I believe that holding Bitcoin on your balance sheet shouldn’t just be a Wall Street luxury.”

Cash App
Cash App, perhaps the most renowned brand within the Block portfolio, completes the retail payments side of the hyperbitcoinization engine Block is building. Introduced in 2013, Cash App is a consumer-focused digital wallet with a reported 57 million active users in 2024, offering person-to-person payments, debit cards, stocks and Bitcoin trading, and tax filing. Cash App reported $10 billion in bitcoin-sourced revenue in 2024, making up 62% the total, by charging ~2% per trade.

Cash App might also be the first mainstream payments app to integrate Lightning, Bitcoin’s payments network. It is at the cutting edge of the industry, producing the highest publicly disclosed, bitcoin-denominated revenue but operating the Lightning Network at 9.7% return. This is not some weird crypto magic yield, and can only be achieved by making sure bitcoin payments are incredibly efficient and reliable. Suter noted that “to me, it’s proof that Bitcoin is already a functioning payment network, not digital gold. It’s more than that. And I don’t want to get too into the weeds here, but I can confidently say that we have the most talented set of Lightning engineers in the world working on these problems.”

Exalted about the success of Cash App’s Bitcoin integration, Suter added that “we’re super excited about Lightning’s role in making Bitcoin everyday money because that’s really, from a Block Inc. perspective, we believe that’s essential for Bitcoin’s future, Satoshi’s original vision, peer-to-peer electronic cash.”

Consumers cannot just easily buy and send bitcoin via Cash App, but also automate purchases, an investment strategy known as DCA or dollar cost averaging, which has been mathematically demonstrated to be one of the best investment strategies there are in bitcoin. 

The combination of Cash App and Square unlocks what tech people call a “fly wheel,” a term used to describe self-reinforcing loops of consumer and business behavior that can drive a business to new heights and which is usually not possible if a building block in that business logic is missing. Perhaps with these two major integrations, the vision of Bitcoin payments dreamt about by early adopters for over a decade, which have not really worked very well up until now, can finally become a reality. 

Bitkey
Anchored in the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin — censorship resistance through individual liberty and self custody — Block has launched a new hardware wallet product called Bitkey. The device is designed specifically for Bitcoin security, using a popular technology called multisignature, which decentralize the passwords — private keys— needed to move the bitcoin to three different devices: the Bitkey hardware, a key stored for recovery in Block’s servers and a third key encrypted with the user’s credentials and stored on the user’s chosen Google drive or iCloud account.

he Bitkey, launched globally in 2024, makes various design choices that depart from the way other hardware wallets in the industry function — the most primary and controversial difference being that it never shows private key material to the user. Unlike every other hardware wallet and most self-custody Bitcoin and crypto apps, Bitkey hides key material almost entirely from the user, instead giving them various well-designed tools to secure, recover and inherit their bitcoin securely to their loved ones. Suter noted that “we built Bitkey to expand who can safely self-custody. We — Bitcoiners — joke that you should onboard your grandma to self-custody, but I hear countless stories of that being true and people reaching out because the onboarding was so seamless.”

The device looks and feels like alien technology, every unit with a unique mixed stone pattern, and that lights up to the touch, like it is alive. It is a profound rethinking of self custody, born of a deep critique of the user experience of the traditional Bitcoin seed backup approach. While the design has been in the market for barely a year and no public data on sales numbers has been released, it will be interesting to see if they can break new ground into hardware wallet adoption — a metric historically poor for an industry so culturally defined by self custody.

2025-08-09,Even Robinson Crusoe Understood The Price And Value Of Money - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE1oak5wTjlkLWwtbWtHaURvNWVVdmRHOFJjY2ZiN1B2TUNleFc1QXlSdWxSU0dVTGhjNmtIWmJKSU5oM0VBdFQ0QjdGNUQwa2FJWDVYT29rMHRJMW5hLWUyMVc2N0Vxc2dsbXpqcDFsVU1kcnM5X3d3?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nothing is as crucial to the functionality of a free market as its money. Money constitutes half of every transaction, representing one side of all value expressed in the exchange of goods and services. But what, exactly, is the price of money?

The commodity with the highest marketability tends to become a society’s preferred medium of exchange — that is, its money. Prices denominated in this common medium enable economic calculation, which in turn allows entrepreneurs to spot opportunities, make profits and push civilization forward.

We’ve seen how supply and demand determine the price of goods, but determining the price of money is a bit trickier. Our predicament is that we have no unit of account to measure the price of money because we already express prices in… you guessed it, money. And because we cannot use monetary terms to explain it, we must find another way to express money’s purchasing power.

People buy and sell money (exchange goods and services for it) based on what they expect that money will buy them in the future. As we’ve learned, acting individuals always make choices on the margin. Hence, the law of diminishing marginal utility. In other words, all actions are preceded by a value judgment in which actors choose between their most valued end and their next strongest desire. The law of diminishing marginal utility applies here as it does elsewhere: the more units of a good a person possesses, the less urgent the satisfaction each additional unit provides.

Money behaves no differently. Its value lies in the additional satisfaction it can provide. Whether that’s buying food, security or future options doesn’t matter. When people trade their labor for money, they do so only because they value the purchasing power of that money more than the immediate use of their time. The cost of money in an exchange is thus the highest utility a person could have derived from the amount of cash they gave up. If a person chooses to work for an hour to afford a rib-eye steak, they must value the meal more than one hour of forgone leisure.

Recall that the law of diminishing marginal returns tells us that each successive unit of a homogenous good satisfies a less urgent desire a person has. Therefore, the value a person attaches to an additional unit diminishes for each unit added. However, what constitutes a homogenous good is entirely up to the individual. Since value is subjective, the utility of each additional monetary token depends on what the individual wants to achieve. To the individual, each extra token is not homogenous in terms of what serviceability it brings to them. To a person who wishes to buy nothing but hot dogs with his money, a “unit of money” is the same as whatever the price of a hot dog is. That person has not added a unit of the homogenous good “money for hot dogs” until he has acquired enough cash to buy one more hot dog.

This is why Robinson Crusoe could look upon a pile of gold and deem it worthless. It couldn’t buy him food, tools or shelter. In isolation, money is meaningless. Like all languages, it requires at least two people to function. Money, above all, is a tool for communication.

Inflation and the Illusion of Idle Money
People choose to save, spend, or invest based on their time preference and their expectations about money’s future value. If they expect purchasing power to increase, they’ll save. If they expect it to fall, they’ll spend. Investors make similar judgments, often redirecting money toward assets they believe will outpace inflation. But whether saved or invested, money is always doing something for its owner. Even money “on the sidelines” serves a clear purpose: lowering uncertainty. A person who holds onto money instead of spending it is satisfying their desire for optionality and safety.

This is why the idea of money “in circulation” is misleading. Money does not flow like a river. It is always held by someone, always owned, always performing a service. Exchanges are actions, and actions happen at specific points in time. Therefore, there is no such thing as idle money.

Without its connection to historical prices, money would be unmoored, and personal economic calculation would be impossible. If a loaf of bread cost $1 last year and costs $1.10 today, we can infer something about the direction of purchasing power. Over time, these observations form the basis for economic expectations. Governments offer their own version of this analysis: the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

This index is supposed to reflect the “rate of inflation” through a fixed basket of goods. However, CPI deliberately ignores high-value assets like real estate, stocks, and fine art. Why? Because including them would reveal a truth governments would rather hide: Inflation is always far more pervasive than the people behind it admit. Measuring inflation through CPI is an attempt to hide the when-you-really-think-about-it obvious truth about it: The increase in prices is always proportional to the expansion of the money supply eventually. The creation of new money always leads to a decrease in the purchasing power of that money compared to what it could have been.

Price inflation is not caused by greedy producers or supply-chain hiccups. It is always, eventually, the result of monetary expansion. When more money is created, its purchasing power falls. Those closest to the source of new money benefit (banks, asset holders and state-connected companies and corporations), while the poor and wage-earning class bear the brunt of price increases.

The effects are delayed and are difficult to trace directly, which is why inflation is often called the most insidious form of theft. It destroys savings, widens inequality and increases financial instability. Ironically, even the wealthy would be better off under a sound monetary regime. In the long run, inflation harms everyone. Even those who appear to benefit in the short term.

The Origins of Money
If money’s value comes from what it can buy, and if that value is always judged against past prices, how did money acquire its initial worth? To answer this, we must look backward to the barter economy.

The good that evolved into money must have had nonmonetary value before it became money. Its purchasing power must initially have been determined by the demand for some other use case. Once it began serving a second function (as a medium of exchange), its demand increased, and so did its price. The good now served two distinct purposes for the owner: providing utility value on the one hand and functioning as a medium of exchange on the other. The need for the latter use case tends to overshadow the former over time.

This is the core of Mises’ Regression Theorem, which explains how money arises naturally in markets and always retains a link to past valuations. It is not an invention of the state but a spontaneous outgrowth of voluntary trade.

Gold became money because it met the criteria of being a good money: It was durable, divisible, recognizable, portable and scarce. Its use in jewelry and industry still gives it use-value today. For centuries, banknotes were mere receipts redeemable for gold. The lightweight and compact banknote proved the perfect solution to gold’s transportability problem. Unfortunately, the issuers of these receipts quickly realized they could issue more gold tickets (banknotes) than they had backing for in their vaults. This modus operandi is still in use today.

Once the link between gold and banknotes was severed altogether, governments and central banks were free to create money ex nihilo, leading to today’s unbacked fiat systems. Under fiat regimes, politically connected banks can be bailed out, even if they fail. The result is moral hazard, distorted risk signals, and systemic instability, all funded by the quiet expropriation of savings through inflation.

Money’s temporal connection to historical prices is vital for the market process. Without it, personal economic calculations would be impossible. The Money Regression Theorem, described in the previous section, is a praxeological insight often overlooked in discussions about money. It explains why money is not just an imaginary construct by some bureaucratic wizardry but has a real connection to a point when someone’s desire to trade means for a specific end spawned it into existence in the free market.

Money is a product of voluntary exchange, not a political invention, a shared illusion, or a social contract. Any commodity with a limited enough supply could be used as money, presuming it ticked off all the other boxes necessary for a suitable medium of exchange. Anything durable, portable, divisible, uniform, and acceptable will do.

Suppose the Mona Lisa had been infinitely divisible. In that case, its parts could have served as money, but only if there was an easy way to verify that they were actually from the Mona Lisa and not counterfeited.

Speaking of the Mona Lisa, there’s an anecdote about some of the most famous painters of the twentieth century that perfectly illustrates how an increase in the supply of a monetary good affects its perceived value. These painters realized they could use their celebrity status to enrich themselves in a peculiar way. They figured out that their signatures were valuable and that they could pay their restaurant bills by simply signing them. Salvador Dali allegedly even signed the wreck of a car that he had crashed into and thus magically transformed it into a valuable piece of art. Eventually, though, these tactics stopped working. The more signed bills, posters, and car wrecks there were, the less valuable an additional signature became, perfectly demonstrating the law of diminishing returns. By adding quantity, they reduced quality.

The World’s Largest Pyramid Scheme
Fiat currencies operate under similar logic. Increasing the money supply devalues each existing unit. While the early recipients of new money benefit, everyone else suffers. Inflation is not just a technical issue but a moral one, too. It distorts economic calculation, rewards debt over savings, and robs those least able to defend themselves against it. In this light, fiat currency is the world’s largest pyramid scheme, enriching the top at the expense of the base.

We accept broken money because it’s what we’ve inherited, not because it serves us best. However, when enough people realize that sound money (money that can’t be counterfeited) is better for the market and humanity, we may stop settling for fake gold receipts that cannot feed us and start building a world where value is real, honest and earned.

Sound money arises through voluntary choice, not political decree. Any item that satisfies the basic criteria of money can serve as money, but only sound money allows civilization to flourish long-term. Money is not merely an economic tool but a moral institution. When money is corrupted, everything downstream — savings, prices incentives and trust — is distorted. But when money is honest, the market can coordinate production, signal scarcity, reward thrift, and protect the vulnerable.

In the end, money is more than a means of exchange. It is a safeguard of time, a record of trust, and the most universal language of human cooperation. Corrupt that, and you don’t just break the economy. You break civilization itself.

“Man is a short-sighted creature, sees but a very little way before him, and as his passions are none of his best friends, so his particular affections are generally his worst counselors.”

Counterfeiting: Modern Money and the Fiat Illusion
Now that we’ve explored how a saleable good becomes money on the free market and how low-time-preference thinking leads to progress and falling prices, we can take a closer look at how money functions today. You may have heard about negative interest rates and

wondered how they square with the fundamental principle that time preference is always positive. Or perhaps you’ve noticed rising consumer prices, with media outlets blaming everything but monetary expansion. 

The truth about modern money is a hard pill to swallow because once you understand the magnitude of the problem, things start looking pretty bleak. Human beings cannot resist the urge to enrich themselves by exploiting others through printing money. The only way to prevent this, it seems, would be to remove us from the process altogether, or, at the very least, separate money from state control. Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek believed this could only be done in “some sly, roundabout way.”

The United Kingdom was the first nation to weaken the link between national currencies and gold. Before World War I, nearly all currencies were redeemable in gold, a standard that had emerged over thousands of years as gold became the most saleable good on Earth. However, by 1971, convertibility was abandoned entirely when U.S. President Richard Nixon famously proclaimed he would “temporarily suspend the convertibility of the dollar into gold” and unilaterally severed the final link between the two. He did this (at least partially) to finance the Vietnam War and preserve his political power.

We won’t dive into every detail of fiat currency here, but here’s what matters: State-issued money today is not backed by anything tangible but entirely created as debt. Fiat currency masquerades as money, but unlike actual money (which emerges from voluntary exchange), fiat is a tool of debt and control.

Every new dollar, euro or yuan enters existence when a large bank issues a loan. That money is expected to be paid back with interest. And since that interest is never created alongside the principal, there is never enough money in circulation to repay all debts. In fact, more debt is necessary to keep the system alive. Modern central banks further manipulate the money supply through mechanisms like bailouts, which prevent inefficient banks from failing, and quantitative easing, which adds even more fuel to the fire.

Quantitative easing is when a central bank purchases government bonds by creating new money, effectively trading IOUs for freshly printed currency. A bond is a promise by the government to repay the borrowed money with interest. That promise is backed by the state’s power to tax present and future citizens while you and your heirs are forced to cope with rising prices. The result is a quiet, continuous wealth extraction from productive people through inflation and debt servitude.

Money printing continues under the banner of Keynesian economics — the doctrine that underpins most modern government policies. Keynesians argue that spending is what drives an economy forward and that if the private sector doesn’t keep spending, the government must. Every dollar spent, they claim, adds one dollar’s worth of value to the economy, but this view ignores the reality of value dilution through inflation. It’s Bastiat’s Broken Window Fallacy all over again. Adding zeros adds precisely zero value. 

If money printing could actually increase wealth, we’d all own super yachts at this point. Wealth is created through production, planning and voluntary exchange, not by increasing the number of digits on a central bank’s balance sheet. Real progress stems from people trading with others and their future selves by accumulating capital, delaying gratification and investing in the future.

Fiat Currency’s Final Destination
Printing more money doesn’t speed up the market process, but distorts and retards it. Literally. Slow and stupid follows. Ever-decreasing purchasing power makes economic calculation more difficult and slows down long-term planning.

All fiat currencies eventually die. Some collapse via hyperinflation. Others are abandoned or absorbed into larger systems (such as smaller national currencies being replaced by the euro). But before their end, fiat currencies serve a hidden purpose — they transfer wealth from those who create value to those with political proximity.

This is the essence of the Cantillon effect, named after 18th-century economist Richard Cantillon. When new money enters the economy, its first recipients benefit most — they can buy goods before prices rise. Those furthest from the source (ordinary workers and savers) absorb the cost. Being poor in a fiat system is very expensive.

Despite this, politicians, central bankers and establishment economists continue to assert that a “healthy” inflation rate is necessary. They should know better. Inflation does not fuel prosperity. At best, it shifts purchasing power. At worst, it erodes the very foundation of civilization by undermining trust in money, savings and cooperation. The abundance of cheap goods in today’s world was created in spite of taxes, borders, inflation and bureaucracy — not because of them.

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
When left unhampered, we know that the market process tends to deliver better goods at lower prices for more people. That’s what real progress looks like. Interestingly, praxeology isn’t just a tool for critique but a framework for appreciation. Many people grow cynical once they see how deep the dysfunction runs, but praxeology offers clarity: It helps you see how productive people are the real drivers of human flourishing. Not governments. Once you understand this point, even the most mundane forms of labor take on greater meaning. The supermarket cashier, the cleaning staff and the taxi driver all contribute to a system that meets human needs through voluntary cooperation and value creation. They are civilization.

Markets produce goods. Governments, by contrast, tend to produce bads. Catallactic competition, where businesses strive to serve customers better, is the engine of innovation. Political competition, where parties fight to control the state, rewards manipulation, not merit. The most adaptable rise in markets. The most unscrupulous rise in politics.

Praxeology helps you understand human incentives. It teaches you to watch what people do, not just what they say. More importantly, it teaches you to consider what could have been, not just what is. That’s the unseen world, the alternative timelines erased by intervention.

Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt
Human psychology is biased toward fear. We evolved to survive threats, not to admire flowers. That’s why alarmism spreads faster than optimism. The proposed solution to every “crisis” — whether related to terrorism, pandemics, or climate change — is always the same: more political control.

Those who study human action know the reason why. For every individual actor, the end always justifies the means. The problem is, this fact is true for power-seekers, too. They offer security in exchange for freedom, but history shows us that fear-driven trade-offs rarely pay off. When you understand these dynamics, the world becomes clearer. The noise fades.

You turn off the television. You reclaim your time. And you realize that accumulating capital and freeing your time are not selfish acts. They are the basis for helping others.

Investing in yourself — in your skills, savings, and relationships — enlarges the pie for everyone. You participate in the division of labor. You produce value. And you do so voluntarily. The most radical action you can take in a broken system is to build something better outside of it.

Every time you use a fiat currency, you pay its issuers with your time. If you can avoid using them altogether, you help usher in a world with less theft and deceit. It may not be easy, but endeavors worth pursuing rarely are.

2025-08-08,This Bitcoin ETF Strategy Has Outperformed BTC Buy-and-Hold - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE4wTWthSmozM29MZl9Denk3TFdNS09vTXZ1VThzSVNJQzhwSDBkN180dnRBcl9qdmw5bVg4dGxPbE5lekhEUml5VkpLeGl6eWo4ejNLZXhMWUtqdDdNNnNkRWpkV0Y5RzhKdEI0M21iRUlRX2ZvRVBxdw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bitcoin ETF inflows are accelerating the influence of institutional investors on the market, reshaping BTC’s supply dynamics and overall structure. As these ETFs have flooded into the space, many see this wave of institutional participation as an unprecedented shift in Bitcoin’s narrative. But what if this institutional data could be used not just to observe the market, but to outperform bitcoin itself?

Who Really Buys Bitcoin ETFs? Defining ‘Institutional’
The term “institutional” is frequently used as shorthand for ETF buyers, but in reality, these inflows represent a mix of high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and some actual institutional funds. Perhaps only 30–40% are what we would consider true institutions. Regardless, ETF Cumulative Flows have grown exponentially to almost 1.2 million BTC since January 2024. That’s a transformative amount, arguably removing a meaningful chunk of available supply from the open market indefinitely. 

This kind of accumulation, especially when paired with long-term holding behavior from treasury companies and potentially even nation-states, has permanently altered Bitcoin’s liquidity profile. These coins may never re-enter circulation.

Turning ETF Flow Data Into a Profitable Bitcoin Trading Strategy
Many assume these ETF participants are the epitome of smart money, savvy investors moving against the grain to exploit retail sentiment. But the data tells a different story. Analysis of the ETF Daily Flows (USD) chart reveals a herd-like behavior of buying heavily into local tops and capitulating at local bottoms. 

A comparison between ETF Flows and Bitcoin Funding Rates, a retail sentiment barometer, shows an uncanny synchronicity. Institutions are essentially buying and selling in lockstep with retail, not ahead of them. This shouldn’t be surprising. Human psychology, cognitive bias, and FOMO don’t stop affecting people just because they manage large sums of money. Even treasury departments of large corporations often end up buying into bullish euphoria.

Bitcoin ETF Flow Strategy vs. Buy-and-Hold: The Results
If ETF buyers are simply following the trend of buying as price increases and selling as price decreases, then their inflows and outflows can serve as a potential entry/exit signal, or better yet, as a momentum indicator when interpreted correctly. To test this theory, we created a simple strategy using ETF flow data via the Bitcoin Magazine Pro API.

The logic is straightforward: buy Bitcoin when ETFs show inflows, and sell when they show outflows. It isn’t a perfect signal; early trades show drawdowns and a noticeable underperformance compared to buy and hold, but when this strategy is applied over the full span since ETFs launched, the returns are impressive. Nearly 200% versus approximately 155% for a buy-and-hold strategy. Even when factoring in a nominal 20% taxation rate on profitable trades, the strategy still outperformed.

Should You Use a Bitcoin ETF Flow Strategy?
This kind of tactical strategy isn’t for everyone. Many Bitcoiners are long-term holders who would never consider selling. But for those willing to manage risk and capture edge in the market, this ETF-based strategy offers a way to leverage the behavior of the big market participants.

So, does following institutional flows give you an edge? On its own, probably not a consistent one. While undoubtedly impressive, it has worked this long, I personally have doubts this will work over multiple cycles. But paired with the broader market context, it becomes a useful tool for gauging the trend and reinforcing other signals to compound returns."

FinCEN, the regulator responsible for licensing, monitoring, and enforcement actions concerning criminal activity in money transmission has itself explicitly stated that self-custodial tooling that facilitates the transmission of value using cryptocurrencies are not money transmitters and are not subject to the relevant regulations.

So, how did we get here? Eight months after the election of a president who describes himself as a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency advocate, after the Department of Justice themselves have explicitly stated that they are not going to engage in regulation by prosecution, or prosecute mixing services, how was Roman Storm found guilty?

There is nothing to describe this situation except pure, unbridled insanity. Incoherence. Hypocrisy and contradiction. There is a lesson here, though, one that I think it’s time more people in this space learn. 

The government’s word is worthless. It means nothing. 

They will continue cracking down on privacy, they will continue pushing KYC surveillance through things like the GENIUS Act and through the backdoor, applying them to just stablecoins (for now). They will continue treating the desire for privacy as evidence of criminal intent. They will do all these things while talking out of the other side of their mouth about supporting Bitcoiners and the “importance of self custody.” 

This is what the government does. This is what politicians do. It is inherent in their very nature. 

We need to stop treating these people as our friends. We need to stop pretending and lying to ourselves that they can be won over and become powerful allies to push the values and tools that we wish to see in the world. They are not our friends. They will not become allies, sharing a common cause with us. They are our enemies. 

It is time to stop pretending. These people must be treated as hostile, and dealt with as such. 

We need to stop begging them for clauses and riders in bills. We need to take them to court. We need to stop kissing their ass and pandering to their egos and notion of public persona. We need to call them out as the two-faced spineless people they are. 

If there is any legitimacy whatsoever to the legal foundations of the United States government, we do not need new laws, we do not need these people’s permission — we have the Constitution. Remind them of that in court. 

If, at the end of all of that, this system is so corrupt and hypocritical that it functionally ignores the constitutional rights of Americans (and non-Americans), then we need to ignore them. Civil disobedience is the last mechanism we have to hold the government accountable to the foundational constraints they are built upon short of violence. It is time to use it. 

Free human beings do not ask for their freedom; they take it. In a digital age creeping ever closer to Orwellian totalitarianism, that is the only way you will ever attain it."
2025-08-06,Bitcoin Price: The 7 Buy Zones That Preceded Big Rallies — Is The Next One Already Here? - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxOLW9sdzhrRi1jR0NSaVpQcEI4ZVJKNmVBZUFDUWJKdG52QVJsdFdYM3RQMVlORmFNN2VObHFjSF9PQU5faDU4WGQ1VVZkaVdFSnRBMXJuZzdtMmVxbzFMcm54THRhazNDeWJySFNud05NZElnY1F3MDMyMzQ1RUhHNUE3MG8zQ2l1RW5BUDc4UGxmQTFBbFE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In Bitcoin’s humble beginnings, it wasn’t possible to buy bitcoin, as there were no exchanges. There were no hardware wallets to store it and no influencers or the BlackRock marketing team even promoting it.

Just Satoshi, some cypherpunks, libertarians, geeks — and a protocol that most dismissed as a nerd experiment.

The tech was in its infancy. The code had numerous issues and the future was just a cypherpunk dream. The idea was absurd to most — and frankly, it still is… to most.

You see, bitcoin didn’t even have a price for its first year. It was mined, shared and bartered. The code was open, the incentive was to experiment, and try this thing out. 

That all changed with one simple act: a man bought pizza.

Today, with the price hanging by a thread at $114,000 — despite a brief weekend drop to $111K and continually rising geopolitical tensions — bitcoin’s broader uptrend remains technically intact, that is of course according to the “bitcoin charts”. You might be wondering: is this the top, or is the next historical opportunity already here?

The 7 Best Times To Buy Bitcoin 
1. When It Was Worthless (2009–2010)
Bitcoin Price Range: $0.00 to $0.01
Return to $100K: ~+1,000,000,000%

For bitcoin’s first nine months, it had no price. No one sold it. No one bought it. It was mined, discussed on forums, and mostly unnoticed by the outside world. 

In October 2009, the NewLibertyStandard Exchange published a method to calculate bitcoin’s value based on electricity costs — pegging 1,309 BTC to $1. It wasn’t a functioning exchange in the modern sense, but it helped establish a reference price.

On October 12, 2009, the first known exchange of bitcoin for fiat occurred: 5,050 BTC for $5.02 via PayPal — an implied price of $0.00099 per BTC. That was the first moment bitcoin touched the real-world economy.

Then came Laszlo Hanyecz.

On May 22, 2010, he traded 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas — the first recorded exchange of bitcoin for a physical good. At roughly $41 in value, it set the first open-market price: ~$0.0041 per BTC.

From that moment, Bitcoin transcended bits and bytes. It became money, or at least that process had begun.

If you bought (or mined) back then, you weren’t chasing yield. You were taking a leap of faith on an anti-central banking monetary system few people understood. The 2010 overflow bug had just been patched. There were no wallets. No legal clarity. Just raw conviction.

If you bought bitcoin here, you are a certifiable legend. 

This was a good time to buy bitcoin. 

2. During The Dollar Parity Era (2011)
Bitcoin Price Range: $1 to $30
Return to $100K: ~+10,000% to +100,000%

When bitcoin reached $1 in February 2011, it hit a psychological milestone. Suddenly, it was “worth something.”

But the price didn’t stay there for long. Within months, it rocketed to $30 — before crashing 90% down to $2. 

Meanwhile, Satoshi quietly exited the project. Mt. Gox dominated exchange volume but was already showing signs of instability. Those who held through this didn’t have “diamond hands” — they had nothing else like it to believe in. They were early adopters, not tourists. They bought not because it was safe, but because the alternative — fiat — was already proven to fail. 

This was a good time to buy bitcoin. 

3. After The Mt. Gox Collapse (2014–2015)
Bitcoin Price Range: $250 to $315
Return to $100K: ~+31,000%

In 2014, Mt. Gox — which once handled 70% of global bitcoin trades — imploded. 850,000 BTC vanished. Bitcoin fell from $1,100 to under $300. The headlines read “Bitcoin is dead.” Again.

But Bitcoin kept on churning out new blocks. Tick tock, as the saying goes. 

If you understood that Mt. Gox wasn’t Bitcoin — that centralized exchanges don’t define the network — you were able to buy during one of the most misunderstood crashes in financial history. The risk was real, the opportunity was unreal. 

This was a good time to buy bitcoin. 

4. After the ICO Mania Implosion (2018–2019)
Bitcoin Price Range: $3,200 to $7,200
Return to $100K: ~+1,300% to +2,000%

2017 was a blur. ICOs, Ethereum, shitcoins everywhere. Talk of lambos and moon shots.

But by January 2018, the bubble burst. bitcoin crashed over 80%. Most altcoins crashed 95%+. Regulators cracked down, and the whole space entered a deep bear market.

Bitcoin bottomed at $3,200 in December 2018. Most had left. Many never returned.

Yet quietly, something important was happening. Custody improved. Lightning Network came online. Institutions were watching. And beneath the silence, the next cycle was brewing.

If you stacked then, you understood where this train was going.

This was a good time to buy bitcoin. 

5. During The COVID Crash (March 2020)
Bitcoin Price Range: ~$4,000
Return to $100K: ~+2,400%

The world turned upside down in March 2020. Markets imploded and bitcoin dropped over 50% in a day, from $8,000 to below $4,000.

Those with macro or trading experience — or had their ears to the ground may have been ready for this one. For others, it was a wake-up call. This was the moment when the fragility of the fiat system became abundantly clear, just months after the repo market cracks were causing the markets concern..

By August, MicroStrategy entered the scene. Michael Saylor labelled cash “a melting ice cube” and converted his balance sheet into BTC, starting with $250 million.

That move sparked the institutional dominoes. Square, Tesla, banks, and sovereigns followed.

If you bought during the March crash, you saw what others couldn’t: that Bitcoin was the solution, and not part of the problem.

This was a good time to buy bitcoin. 

6. When FTX Collapsed (Late 2022)
Bitcoin Price Range: $15,500–$17,000
Return to $100K: ~+588% to +666%

The 2021/22 bull market didn’t have the usual blow-off top. Instead, it slowly bled out, catching many people off guard. As the bleeding seemed to be coming to an end, FTX collapsed. In 48 hours, Sam Bankman-Fried went from darling of the media (and grifter to the Bitcoin community) to complete fraud by everybody. bitcoin crashed to $15,500 in November.

FTX had risen out of nowhere. Its fall was as quick as it was inevitable, in hindsight. 

I remember Preston Pysh catching that falling knife. Military vets are built differently. If you stacked at this point in time, you weren’t listening to Gareth Soloway’s $10k calls. You trusted yourself. You tuned out the noise — and got your just desserts.

This was a good time to buy bitcoin. 

7. Before The ETF Approval (January 2024)
Bitcoin Price Range: $43,000–$50,000
Return to $100K: ~+100% to +132%

For over a decade, retail carried bitcoin on its back. Developers, plebs, miners, and maxis — they were the early adopters. The true believers. They bought, held, and educated while Wall Street laughed from the sidelines.

Then in January 2024, the dam broke.

After years of legal battles and delays, the SEC approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. The fastest-growing ETF launch in history followed. Blackrock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton piled in. The “wall of money” had arrived.

The smart money wasn’t buying Blackrock & Co’s financial products. It was the retail stackers who front-ran them – The ones who bought when CNBC still called it tulips. The ones who understood that ETFs don’t change Bitcoin’s fundamentals — they just unlock new capital.

Buying under $50K — before the ETFs were rubber-stamped — was a calculated act of foresight. You weren’t late. You were early. Again.

This was a good time to buy bitcoin. 

So… What About Now?
Bitcoin’s price is hovering just above $100,000. For many, it feels like the big opportunity has passed.

But that’s a short-sighted view.

According to Power Law Theory (PLT) — a mathematical model that maps bitcoin’s price against time, adoption, and network effect — we may only be halfway through the current cycle’s journey, and a mere fraction of the way to full global monetization.

The PLT formula is: Price = Age^(5.7). For example:

Age 8 → ~$1.4K
Age 12 → ~$14K
Age 16 → ~$73K
Age 24 → ~$737K
We’re now in year 16.

Notably, doubling Bitcoin’s age results in approximately 50x price growth, while increasing its age by 50% leads to a 10x increase. If Power Law continues to track — as it has for over a decade — then we’re looking at a possible 10x over the next eight years.

And that’s just one of several long-term models that point in the same direction.

To explore PLT in more depth — along with stock-to-flow, the quantile model, Metcalfe’s Law, and other forecasting methods — check out our bitcoin price predictions. It’s designed to give you the tools, charts, and models to zoom out, take a breath, and think in decades — not days.

You’re not late. You’re just early… with better information and a longer time horizon, you should expect to see bitcoin to continue to grow in value.

So yes, now is a good time to buy bitcoin. "
2025-08-05,Bitcoin Price Holds $115K as White House Targets Bitcoin And Crypto Debanking in New Order - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxQcXRKRzVPVjB5QmEwX1c4Z2U4OEFodnNyM0NZNW9TM2k4eUtleHpoUld0dnFUWTVPWUVVcmk0aXYzRGt5ZW5VS2FBNERmSzlia0JIWXcyUHk2REYxR0tiUHVvaDhQZ2xHN1hJZUd5dWE1cG1tTnlJeHNqMTJ6dVBlS002NUxaUmNEay1jODFqVFJ0UDF5NkN2UmRBTFp4emEyQlJyRmZrTVZzUVNoWmEzdlo1M2dVaEpmekZ1NFJpOS1hRTg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The price of Bitcoin is holding strong at $115,000 as the White House is preparing to crack down on banks accused of debanking Bitcoin & cryptocurrency companies and politically conservative organizations.

According to a new Wall Street Journal report, the Trump administration is finalizing an executive order that would penalize banks that deny services to customers based on political beliefs or Bitcoin and crypto affiliations — a move that would be a major policy shift in favor of the digital asset industry.

“The White House is preparing to step up pressure against big banks over perceived discrimination against conservatives and crypto companies with an executive order that threatens to fine lenders that drop customers for political reasons,” the WSJ reported.

The draft executive order, viewed by the Journal, directs federal regulators to investigate whether any financial institutions have violated laws such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust rules, or consumer financial protection statutes. If so, violators could be subject to monetary penalties, consent decrees or other disciplinary measures, according to the draft.

The executive order comes after years of complaints from Bitcoin and crypto companies, which have said they were systematically shut out of traditional banking services under the Biden administration. Many firms struggled to maintain checking accounts, access payment processors, or receive basic credit services — a trend known as “crypto debanking.”

Banks have defended their decisions by citing legal, regulatory, or financial risks — particularly concerns about compliance with anti-money-laundering laws. However, under the draft order, regulators would be told to eliminate internal policies that may have contributed to debanking practices and to review banks’ participation in federal lending programs.

While the draft does not explicitly name any banks, it references a controversy involving Bank of America, which was accused of closing accounts belonging to a Christian nonprofit operating in Uganda. The bank responded, saying that it doesn’t serve small businesses operating outside the U.S.

The draft also criticizes banks’ involvement in the federal investigation of the January 6th Capitol riot, further signaling the administration’s intent to confront what it sees as ideological targeting in the financial sector.

“Banks have been on edge about potential action by the Trump administration,” the Journal noted, referencing its earlier June report on similar executive order discussions.

A Bank of America spokesman commented: “We’ve provided detailed proposals and will continue to work with the administration and Congress to improve the regulatory framework.”

As the order could be signed as soon as this week, and with regulators instructed to refer potential violations to the Attorney General, the policy could mark a turning point as the administration’s push to restore banking access could unlock critical infrastructure for crypto firms that have long operated on the fringes of the U.S. banking system."
2025-08-03,The Rise Of Bitcoin Stocks And Bonds - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE1teHYyQ1BtR2RUZWdfZlZxUnVWQlliMWtDTDVGX2o5c2J5dXhya2tubjRQZHlrSXBYYWV2cFJ1Zl9relVKQ2RnS1JQQUR3c0lWZjBkamFNU25VX29JaS1CaGRENHozc0VnMTVVQVN6eURydmhmei12aEx4MTU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"During the past year or so, the Bitcoin ecosystem has largely been led by the rise of corporate bitcoin treasury strategies.

Although Strategy (MSTR) pioneered the trend back in 2020, the follow-on adoption by others was slow. However, after yet another cycle of bear market and bull market activity, as well as a major 2023 FASB update for how bitcoin is accounted for on balance sheets, the years 2024 and 2025 have ushered in a new wave of companies adopting bitcoin as a treasury asset.

This article explores that trend, and examines whether it’s good or bad for the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole. It also touches on the topic of bitcoin as a medium of exchange vs a store of value, which in my view is commonly misunderstood from an economic perspective.

Why Bitcoin Stocks and Bonds?
Back in August 2024 when this trend was pretty nescient, I wrote an article called “A New Look at Corporate Treasury Strategy” that explained the usefulness of bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. Back then, only a handful of companies were making use of it at scale, and since then there’s been a wave of new and existing companies adopting the strategy — bitcoin stocks everywhere. And the bitcoin stocks that were doing it at scale back then, such as Strategy and Metaplanet, are up huge in terms of price and market capitalization.

That article explained why corporations should consider implementing the strategy. But what about investors? Why has this become so popular with them? From an investor perspective, why buy bitcoin stocks and not just buy bitcoin? There are a couple of primary reasons.

Bitcoin Stocks, Reason #1: Capital with a Mandate
There are trillions of dollars of managed capital, and some of that has strict mandates associated with it.

For example, there are stock funds where the portfolio manager can only buy stocks. He or she cannot buy bonds, ETFs, commodities or other things. Just stocks. Similarly, there are bond funds where the portfolio manager can only buy bonds. And, of course, there are more specific mandates, like managers that can only buy healthcare stocks or non-investment-grade bonds, for example.

Some of those managers are bullish on bitcoin. In many cases they own some themselves. But they can’t express that view by sticking bitcoin in a stock fund or a bond fund, since it goes against their mandate. However, if someone creates a stock that has bitcoin on the balance sheet (bitcoin stocks), or a convertible bond for a stock with bitcoin on the balance sheet, that they can buy. The portfolio manager can now express their bullish bitcoin view within their fund for themselves and their investors. That’s a previously untapped market that is increasingly being tapped in the United States, Japan, United Kingdom, South Korea and elsewhere.

I’ll use myself as a tangible micro-example of how a bitcoin treasury company was useful for this purpose. I’ve been running a real-money model portfolio for my free public newsletter since 2018. It lets readers keep track of my positions transparently.

In early 2020 I strongly recommended bitcoin as an investment in my research service, and bought some myself. By extension, I wanted to add some bitcoin exposure to my newsletter portfolio, but the brokerage I use for the portfolio offered no access to bitcoin stocks or bitcoin-related securities at the time. I couldn’t even buy the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) for the model portfolio back then because it traded over the counter rather than on a major exchange.

Fortunately, Strategy (known as MicroStrategy at the time) added bitcoin to its balance sheet in August 2020. That stock traded on the Nasdaq, and my model portfolio brokerage could buy it. So, with my various constraints for that particular portfolio, I was happy to buy MSTR for the growth stocks section to express my bullish view on bitcoin. The portfolio has been long MSTR ever since, and it’s been a great decision for nearly five years now:

The brokerage eventually added GBTC as a buyable security, and of course eventually added the major spot bitcoin ETFs when they became available, and yet I’ve continued to hold onto MSTR in that portfolio as well (for the upcoming second reason described below).

In short, there are many funds, due to mandates, that can only own stocks or bonds with bitcoin exposure; not ETFs or similar securities. Bitcoin treasury corporations (“Bitcoin stocks”) give them access.

This is in addition to, rather than mainly competing with, bitcoin as a bearer asset that individuals can custody themselves.

Bitcoin Stocks, Reason #2: Corporations Have Ideal Leverage
The basic strategy for a corporation to adopt bitcoin as a treasury asset is to just hold some bitcoin instead of cash equivalents. However, the first bitcoin stocks, unlocking this concept, tended to have very high conviction about the idea. As a result, the trend has been not just to buy bitcoin, but to buy bitcoin with leverage.

And it happens to be the case that publicly traded operating corporations have access to better types of leverage than hedge funds and most other types of capital. Specifically, they have the ability to issue corporate bonds.

Hedge funds and certain other pools of capital typically use margin loans. They borrow money and use it to buy more assets, but they risk having a margin call if the value of the assets drops too low relative to the amount of money borrowed. A margin call can force the hedge fund to sell assets if they dip too much in price, even when they have a strong conviction that those assets will recover to new highs. Having to liquidate a good asset at its lows is a catastrophe.

In contrast, corporations can issue bonds, often with multiyear durations. If they hold bitcoin and the price dips, they don’t have to sell prematurely. This gives them a better ability to weather periods of volatility than entities that rely on margin loans. There are still bearish scenarios that could force corporations to liquidate, but those scenarios would involve a much longer bear market occurring, thus making them less likely.

This type of longer-duration corporate leverage is also usually better in the long run than leveraged ETFs. Since leveraged ETFs don’t use long-term debt, their leverage resets daily, and so volatility is often quite bad for them. (Fidelity has a good article that breaks down the numbers with examples.)

From that article, a useful chart shows what happens to a 2x leveraged ETF if the underlying asset alternates between +10% and -10% days. Over time, the leveraged product deteriorates relative to the index that it’s leveraged to:


In practice, the 2x leveraged bitcoin ETF BITU hasn’t really outperformed bitcoin since its inception, despite bitcoin having increased in price during that period. You’d expect the 2x leveraged version to greatly outperform, but instead it mainly just added volatility without superior returns. This chart goes back as far as BITU’s inception:

The same is true when you look at the long-term histories of volatile equity sectors, like the 2x leveraged versions of the financial sector or the energy sector. Over a choppy period, they’ve greatly underperformed:

So, daily leverage is pretty bad unless you’re a short-term trader. Volatility hurts that type of leverage.

However, having longer-duration debt attached to an asset doesn’t generally lead to the same problem. An appreciating asset with multi-year duration debt attached to it is a powerful combination. Therefore, bitcoin treasury companies are useful securities for high-conviction bitcoin bulls that want some reasonably safe leverage to juice the returns.

Not everyone should take on leverage, but those who do will naturally want to do it in the most optimal way. There are now all sorts of different bitcoin treasury companies in terms of their risk profile, size, sector, jurisdiction, and so forth. It’s a genuine market demand that is now being met over time.

Similarly, some of the securities offered by these corporations, such as the convertible debt or the preferred, can offer bitcoin price exposure with less volatility. While some investors may want that extra volatility, others may want less, and the range of available securities provide investors with the specific type of exposure they want.

Do Corporations Help or Hurt Bitcoin’s Mission?
Now that we know why they exist and the niche they fill for investors, the next question to ask is: Are corporations good for the Bitcoin network as a whole? Does their mere existence damage the value of bitcoin as freedom money?

To have a view on whether corporations are good or bad for bitcoin, one must have some sort of pathway in mind for how a decentralized money would theoretically catch on, if it were to do so. What steps would have to happen, and in roughly what order?

So, this section will consist of two steps. The first will be an economic analysis of what it takes for a new form of money to catch on, i.e., an analysis of what a path toward success would even look like. The second will be an analysis of whether corporations add or detract from that path.

Step 1: What Would Success Look Like?
“What would it seem like if it did seem like a global, digital, sound, open source, programmable money was monetizing from absolute zero?

Ludwig Wittgenstein once asked a friend, ‘tell me, why do people say it is more natural to think that the sun rotates around the earth than that the earth is rotating?”’The friend said, ‘well, obviously, because it just seems like the sun is going around the earth.‘ Wittgenstein replied, ‘well, what would it seem like if it did seem like the earth were rotating?‘”
Wittgenstein’s Money, Allen Farrington, 2020

Bitcoin was launched in early 2009. Throughout 2009 and 2010, some enthusiasts mined it, collected it, tested it, speculated with it, or examined if they could contribute to it or improve it in some way. They liked the idea of it.

In 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto himself described on the Bitcoin Talk forum how the network might initially bootstrap some tiny initial value:

As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties:
– boring grey in colour
– not a good conductor of electricity
– not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either
– not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose

and one special, magical property:
– can be transported over a communications channel

If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.

After some initial success, the challenge for bitcoin from there was that the network spawned a million competitors. Countless altcoins arose with similar capabilities, mainly that you could buy it, transfer it, and the recipient could sell it. And stablecoins, introduced in 2014, let you do that with dollar-collateralized tokens rather than free-floating units, which helped strip out the volatility.

In fact, the rise of competitors was the biggest reason why I didn’t buy bitcoin at that time in the early 2010s. It wasn’t that I was against the concept (quite the contrary), but I viewed the industry as 1) filled with speculative froth and 2) able to be copied into oblivion. In other words, there might be a finite supply of bitcoin, but the idea is infinite.

But then in the later 2010s I noticed something: Bitcoin’s network effect was succeeding as portable capital. It was breaking through that ceiling. Much like a communication protocol (whether a spoken language, a written script, or a digital standard), money as a concept greatly benefits from network effects. The more people that use it, the better it is for others to use as well, which is self-reinforcing. And that’s where wanting to hold it really matters. That’s where the network effect has to grow to reach past this niche and crowded stage.

We can categorize two types of money for this context:

The first type of money is “situational money,” which refers to money that can solve a specific problem but that otherwise isn’t of wide interest. An asset that you can buy with your local money, transfer across points of high friction (capital controls, payment deplatforming, etc.), and have the recipient sell/exchange it for their local money, is a situational money. It has value, but being successful on that front does not necessarily lead to wider success.
The second type of money is “ubiquitous money,” which refers to money that, within a given region or industry, is widely accepted as a matter of course. And importantly, the recipient doesn’t sell/exchange it as soon as they get it; they hold it as a cash balance and then potentially re-spend it elsewhere.
In order for something to be used as ubiquitous money, the spender has to already have it, and the recipient has to want to hold it. Notably, people usually want to receive more of what they already have. After all, if a potential recipient wanted to hold it, they likely would have already bought some. So, if a new type of ubiquitous money were to arise, the majority of people would likely first encounter it as an investment, acquire some because they view it as likely to appreciate in purchasing power, and then be willing to receive more of it as payment as well. At that point, they don’t need to be convinced to accept it as payment; they already like the asset, so whether they are buying more of it or people are directly giving it to them as a means of payment, are nearly the same thing.

Bitcoin’s simple and secure design (proof-of-work, fixed supply, limited script complexity, modest node requirements, and a founder that disappeared leaving decentralization in his wake) and early mover advantage (bootstrapping a network effect) gave it the best liquidity and perception of soundness, and thus many people began wanting to buy it and hold it. And so far, that’s where bitcoin has had a ton of success: as a sound and portable store of value that gives the user the option to spend it or exchange it.

A sound, liquid, fungible, portable store of value sits in the intermediate zone between situational money and ubiquitous money. Unlike situational money, it’s increasingly perceived by people as a good thing to hold for the longer run rather than just sell/exchange immediately if you receive some. But unlike ubiquitous money, in most areas it is not yet widely accepted, because the number of people who have taken time to analyze it are still a small minority. It’s a necessary step to bridge between those two types, and I would argue it’s a very long process to go through.

The reason it takes a long time to go through that stage is due to volatility, and due to the sheer size of the existing network effect it is up against that people have their expenses and liabilities denominated in.

If a new monetary network with its own unit (i.e., not pegged to an existing currency as a credit rail on top of it, but rather a fully parallel system to central banks) is going to bootstrap from zero to massive, it requires upward volatility. And any appreciating asset with upward volatility will attract speculators and leverage, which inevitably leads to periods of downward volatility. In other words, it’ll look like this:

During its adoption phase — where it’s going from worth nothing to worth the equivalent of trillions of dollars — it makes a rather flawed form of near-term money. If you receive some bitcoin and want to use it to pay your rent at the end of the month (and are on a pretty tight budget, i.e., not swimming in excess cash), neither you nor your landlord can deal with it potentially going down by 20% within the span of a month. The landlord has expenses in the existing network effect of fiat currency; she needs to reliably know what her value in rent from the tenant will be. And you, as a renter, need to make sure you can pay your rent at the end of the month with money that won’t surprise you with a rapid loss in value. The same is true for other costs of living in general.

And so, bitcoin is treated mainly as an investment during this era. Hardcore enthusiasts will be more likely to want to spend it. People with specific payment problems (capital controls, payment deplatforming, and so forth) are more likely to want to spend it as well, although they increasingly have similarly liquid options like stablecoins for that purpose. The fact that stablecoins are centralized doesn’t matter much if you’re primarily using them for a few days, weeks, or months like a checking account.

There are some very well-meaning Bitcoin proponents trying to convince bitcoin holders to spend it more. I don’t particularly view that as a sustainable practice. Bitcoin is not going to catch on as a charity. In order for spending it to catch on persistently at scale (i.e., not just billions of dollar-equivalents in annual global medium-of-exchange volume, but trillions), it has to solve problems for spenders and/or recipients that other solutions are not doing. And at this stage of adoption, that’s not necessarily the case, especially with capital gains taxes applicable to every single transaction and with options like stablecoins for near-term spending needs where volatility needs to be low. The best advice I can give to these proponents is that while educating people is good (keep it up!), it is important to manage expectations along the way and understand the economic path dependencies at play.

This is where the topic of optionality is important, and it’s a topic I observe to be widely misunderstood or underappreciated.

Owning a sound, liquid, fungible, portable store of value that is going through its adoption phase gives the owner some perks, or options, that other assets do not. Mainly, they can bring their store of value wherever they want in the world without relying on central counterparties and credit. It also allows them to make cross-border payments, including to deplatformed recipients, through substantial friction even if they are staying put where they are. They might not be able to ubiquitously pay with it, but if need be they can find ways to convert it to local currency in most environments that they find themselves in, and in some cases can indeed pay with it directly.

When analyzed through this lens, bitcoin is incredibly successful. To see why, first we have to understand how shockingly unsalable most monies are.

Imagine you are going to go to a random country. What money or other portable, liquid, fungible bearer asset can you bring with you to ensure that you have plenty of buying power without relying on a global chain of credit? In other words, even if all your credit cards shut off, how can you ensure that you could, with some annoyance and friction, still be able to transact?

The best answer currently is generally physical U.S dollars. If you bring U.S dollars with you, then although you may have trouble directly spending them with many types of merchants, it’s pretty easy to find someone willing to convert dollars to local currency at a reasonable rate and with sufficient liquidity.

The second, third, and fourth best answers are probably gold and silver coins, and euros. Once again, it’s really not that hard to find brokers in most countries willing to take gold and silver, or euros, and give you fair local value in return.

After that, it starts to fall off pretty rapidly: Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, British pounds and some others are in the top ten. This is where there tends to be more frictions for conversion. I would put bitcoin in the top ten at this point, somewhere in the #5-10 range, particularly if the place you’re going to is any sort of urban center. Most cities will have plenty of conversion options that you can seek out if need be. That’s remarkable considering that it’s only 16 years old.

Below that, is the long tail of 160+ other fiat currencies. I often use the examples of Egyptian pounds and Norwegian kroner, since I go to Egypt every year and Norway every couple of years and tend to have a bit of their paper money around. They’re terrible money outside of their own countries, as are the vast majority of currencies.

Dollars are the most liquid money in the world today. Smaller and less liquid assets are almost always priced in larger and more liquid assets, rather than the other way around. The larger and more liquid monetary network is what people use as their unit of account and have most of their liabilities denominated in, so that is their reference point.

A long time ago, dollars were defined by a certain amount of gold. Eventually the dollar network became larger and more ubiquitous than gold, and the situation flipped: now gold is primarily priced in dollars. In the long arc of time, bitcoin could flip the dollar in this way, but it’s not anywhere near that level yet. It doesn’t matter what bitcoin is priced in along the way; it’s a bearer asset that can be priced in whatever the largest and most liquid money is, and if it one day becomes the largest and most liquid money, then other things would routinely be priced in it as a matter of course.

While people are free to mentally price things in whatever they want, it’s unreasonable to expect most people to price things in bitcoin any time soon. And it doesn’t make sense for critics to describe this as a flaw of bitcoin; there’s no other path that a new decentralized monetary asset can bootstrap through than to be routinely priced in the existing currencies while it is small and growing.

Step 2: How Corporations and Bitcoin Stocks Fit In
Back in 2014, Pierre Rochard wrote a prescient article called “Speculative Attack.”

A speculative attack in FX markets refers to borrowing a weak currency to buy more of a strong currency or other superior assets. It’s one of the reasons why central banks raise rates to strengthen their currencies; it helps disincentivize them from being borrowed too rapidly relative to other currencies. If that proves insufficient, some countries will turn to outright capital controls to prevent entities from arbitraging their mismanaged currency (and those capital controls themselves come at economic costs, as who wants to do business in a country with tightening capital controls if there are better options elsewhere?).

Wikipedia provides a useful definition:

In economics, a speculative attack is a precipitous selling of untrustworthy assets by previously inactive speculators and the corresponding acquisition of some valuable assets (currencies, gold).

Well, in Rochard’s article, he described that eventually, due to bitcoin’s appreciating nature, various entities will end up borrowing currencies to buy more bitcoin. Bitcoin was a bit over $600 at the time, with a market capitalization of a bit over $8 billion.

At first, borrowing to buy bitcoin was just around the margins. But now that the Bitcoin network is highly liquid and has a $2+ trillion market capitalization, it has entered mainstream capital markets at scale with billions of dollars of corporate bonds outstanding for the specific purpose of buying more bitcoin.

Here in the present, 11 years later where it’s routinely happening, is this good or bad for Bitcoin as a network?

From what I have seen, there are two main types of critics that would say it is not good for the Bitcoin network.

The first type of critic is themselves a subset of bitcoin users. Many of them are in the cypherpunk camp, or the self-sovereignty camp. To hand over bitcoin to custodians seems dangerous, or at least against the ethos of the network, from many of their perspectives. A term I’ve seen used by some of them to refer to corporate bitcoin treasury proponents is “suitcoiners” which I think is a great term. This bitcoin camp as a whole would much rather people hold their own private keys. Some of them go further and say that rehypothecation of major custodians could suppress the price or otherwise impair bitcoin’s ability to succeed as freedom money. While I like the values of this camp (and am basically in it myself), some of them seem to hold utopian dreams where everyone becomes as interested in fully controlling their own money as they are.

The second type of critic are generally people who have stated a negative view of bitcoin in the past. They have questioned bitcoin’s ability to succeed over many years. As it keeps rising to new heights as the best-performing asset around, many years and multiple cycles later, some of them have instead changed their view to something like, “bitcoin may be going up in price, but it has been captured.” I take this camp less seriously than the first camp, and view it mostly as cope. It’s similar to permabears in equity markets that, when their bearish thesis hasn’t played out after a decade, shift to saying something like, “the market is only up because the Fed printed so much money.” My response to that would be, “well, yeah, that’s why you shouldn’t have been bearish.”

What I would say to both of those camps is to point out that just because some large pools of capital choose to hold bitcoin, it does not mean that “free range” bitcoin is in any way impaired. It can be self-custodied and sent peer-to-peer just like it always has been. And if anything, as many other types of entities hold it, it makes the network larger and less volatile, which improves its usefulness as peer-to-peer money as well. It also potentially provides political cover to help normalize the asset relative to policymakers that want to cause it harm. Bitcoin stocks and large pools of capital buying bitcoin were always going to happen if it reached this scale.

One of the skills that permabears have (regardless of the asset in question) is to pivot the narrative whenever needed so that regardless of what’s happening, they’re right and the asset is unsuccessful. For bitcoin, it means creating a narrative such that there is no conceivable path to success or any reasonable definition of what success looks like. If it’s stuck at the niche retail level? Then its price appreciation and ability to positively impact the world is impaired- see it is failing! If it’s adopted by large entities and governments and continues to grow massively? Then it’s captured and lost its way!

But if it’s going to become large, widely accepted, and change the world in some way, how does that path not go through corporations and governments at some point? 

Bitcoin has gone through a few major eras in terms of who is moving the price and accumulating most rapidly.

In era one, people mined it on their computers, or they sent money to a trading card exchange in Japan (Mt Gox) to buy some, and other friction-filled early-adopter types of things. This was the super-early user era.

In era two, particularly after Mt Gox blew up, it became easier to buy and use. On-shore exchanges let people in many countries buy bitcoin much more easily than before. The first hardware wallets came out in 2014, which made it safer to self-custody bitcoin. This was the retail buyer era, where frictions were still present but were diminishing.

In era three, it became large and liquid enough, and with a sufficiently long track record, to attract more institutions. Entities built institutional-grade custodians for it. Publicly-traded corporations started buying some, and various ETFs and other financial products came out to allow various funds and managed pools of capital to get exposure. Some nation states like the Kingdom of Bhutan, El Salvador, and the UAE mined it or bought it and hold it at the sovereign level. Others like the U.S. have chosen to hold their confiscated coins rather than keep selling them back to the market.

Fortunately — and this is important — each era still includes the prior ones. Even though corporations are doing most of the net buying currently, retail investors can still buy as much as they want as well. It has never been easier to buy bitcoin and take safe self custody of it. There are plenty of resources explaining how to do it, multiple inexpensive and robust wallet solutions, and on-chain transaction fees are currently low.

I see people say things like, “I thought bitcoin was supposed to be for the people. For peer-to-peer cash. Now it’s all big corporations.” And it is for the people- anyone with an internet access can buy it, hold it, or send it. None of that is negated by large entities (which are also run by people) buying it as well.

That is why I’m in agreement with both the cypherpunks and the suitcoiners. I want bitcoin to be useful as freedom money, and that’s in large part why I’m a general partner at Ego Death Capital, where we provide capital to startup companies that build solutions for the Bitcoin network and its users. That’s also why I support the Human Rights Foundation and other nonprofits as they fund developers and education providers that focus on providing financial tools to people in authoritarian or inflationary environments. And yet, it’s also rational that large pools of capital, whether it be corporations, investment funds, or even sovereign entities, are going to buy bitcoin once they figure it out. It’s large and liquid enough to be on their radar now.

It’s important to remember that the majority of people are not active investors. They don’t buy individual stocks, and they don’t deeply analyze the difference between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. If they do speculate on something as a trader, they’re likely to buy in at the top and get shaken out at the bottom. Investments are often assigned to them in passive ways rather than chosen by them for themselves. In older days, it was typically a pension. Today it’s often automatic 401(k) employer matching with a mix of index funds, or a financial advisor picking investments for them.

In my view, it’s unreasonable to expect billions of people to flock to bitcoin as an active decision. It is, however, reasonable to work hard to make it so that anyone can access bitcoin if they choose to by making the barriers to entry as low and frictionless as possible via technological solutions and educational resources. Thanks to the hard work of many, frictions have never been lower than they are right now.

The best phrasing I’ve seen for this is: “Bitcoin is for anyone, not everyone.” What this means in practice is that everyone should be led to water on the topic, but only a subset will choose to drink.

Summary Points
To summarize this longform article, the way Bitcoin’s monetization has unfolded so far is roughly like this, and none of it should be surprising:

Bitcoin started out as a collectible for enthusiasts and/or people with big dreams for change. A neat new technological possibility to play with that might one day be worth something or provide some value to people, with varying levels of conviction.
Bitcoin started to become useful for situational medium-of-exchange purposes, even by pragmatists who were otherwise not focusing on it. Need to send money to a country with capital controls? Bitcoin could succeed where other payment rails failed. Need to receive payments or donations despite being deplatformed from the major online payment portals, like Wikileaks? Bitcoin could be a great workaround. This established some degree of novel utility.
Various frictions like high volatility, countless competitors, and capital gains taxes acted as headwinds against bitcoin’s continued growth as a common medium of exchange. It still is growing for that use, but remains relatively small in that sense relative to what some people thought it might be like after 16 years. If you spend bitcoin with a merchant that does not hold bitcoin, and they auto-convert it to fiat currency, then the benefits of bitcoin are not being fully realized, and there’s a ceiling on how useful it will be for that purpose. Every point of currency exchange is a friction, and the network effects are weak for a “receive and immediately sell” situational type of asset/network, which results in a crowded field of competition at this stage.
Bitcoin became recognized more broadly as the ideal form of portable appreciating capital. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, it reached a level of decentralization, security, simplicity, scarcity, and scale that made it attractive to hold for years with confidence. This is where network effects are more powerful. While it’s not always easy to buy coffee with it, it has started to reach into the top ten bearer assets that you could bring with you internationally and exchange for local value, surpassing the vast majority of the 160+ fiat currencies in that regard.
The Bitcoin network reached sufficient liquidity, scale, and longevity to attract the positive interest of corporations and governments. There are huge pools of managed capital that are interested in the asset, and corporations and funds give them indirect access to it. Meanwhile, bitcoin continues to exist as an open and permissionless network, which means individuals continue to use it and build upon it as well.

We can then look at two more levels, which are potentially ahead if the network keeps expanding:
As the Bitcoin network becomes larger, more liquid, and less volatile, the more interesting it can become for large sovereign entities. What starts out as a small sovereign fund investment can eventually find its way into currency reserves or as a method of international settlement at scale. Countries keep trying to build closed source alternative payment methods with little adoption or agreement for them, while this open source settlement network with a finite supply of its own independent units is gradually bootstrapping itself across the world.
The larger, more liquid, and less volatile it becomes, the more attractive it can become for shorter-term holding periods as well, and thus can potentially assert itself as a more ubiquitous medium of exchange. This should only be expected when tons of people already hold it and are already comfortable with it, and when its purchasing power can be relied upon in the short term in addition to the long term.
Overall, I continue to view Bitcoin as being in a good place technically and economically, and its path of adoption is expanding as expected.

Mining data offers some of the most nuanced and real-time signals of market sentiment and profitability, so understanding how miners are reacting can provide deep insights into upcoming Bitcoin price trends.

Bitcoin Miner Capitulation
We begin by examining the recent pullback in Bitcoin’s hashrate, which triggered one of the most significant drops in Bitcoin miner difficulty we’ve seen in recent history. A confluence of factors likely contributed to this decline, notably a seasonal spike in electricity costs in places like Texas, along with a sustained period of flat bitcoin price action and thinning profit margins for mining firms. 

The exponential rise in hashrate throughout the cycle has led to growing competition, tightening margins even further. During times of low volatility and stagnant price action, miners sometimes temporarily scale down operations to preserve profitability.

Hash Ribbons Signal
This drop and recovery in hashrate created a rare signal from the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicator, which tracks the 30-day and 60-day moving averages of the hashrate. When the shorter average crosses below the longer, it signals miner capitulation. But when it crosses back above, like it just has, it generates a “buy” signal. Historically, these buy signals have been among the most reliable indicators for upcoming bullish price action.

Bitcoin Miner Profitability
Looking at miner revenue in USD terms via The Puell Multiple, a comparison of current daily earnings to the 365-day average, we saw this metric fall below 1 during the hashrate pullback. This confirms that miners were earning less than their historical average, reinforcing why many scaled back operations. At the lowest, miners were only earning about 89% of their average from the past year. But this quickly rebounded to a recent Puell Multiple of around 1.5, which is a strong sign of profitability returning to the sector. This pattern of capitulation, recovery, and breakout is strikingly similar to behavior seen after the 2016 halving, which led to the massive 2017 bull run.

Long-Term Parallels
Despite institutional involvement and the changing structure of Bitcoin ownership, miner behavior continues to follow historic patterns. For example, even though miners now earn significantly less from transaction fees (especially in BTC terms) than they did in past cycles, the hashrate continues to rise. This shows miners remain deeply bullish, positioning themselves ahead of anticipated future price appreciation. It also speaks to the resilience and long-term outlook of the mining sector. Fees may be declining due to efficient scaling solutions like the Lightning Network and shifts in Bitcoin’s narrative, but miners are still investing heavily.

Bitcoin Mining Stocks
Bitcoin mining stocks are usually a leveraged play on the price of BTC, and they tend to lead price action. Recently, the stocks of Listed Miners have outperformed bitcoin itself. For instance, Marathon Digital and other listed miners began rallying significantly before bitcoin’s move to new highs. Historical analysis confirms that in past bull markets, mining stocks would peak before major price tops, giving a potential early warning for cycle euphoria. Right now, those stocks are accelerating again, a potential signal that traders are pricing in further upside.

Conclusion
Recent miner behavior is pointing toward renewed confidence and bullish expectations in the market. The hash ribbons buy signal, recovering Puell Multiple, and continued hash rate growth all suggest that the worst of miner capitulation is behind us. Meanwhile, mining stock outperformance hints at further upside. Although these signals should be used in conjunction with broader market analysis, they provide strong evidence that miners expect the next leg up could be just around the corner. "

Simplicity is based on Bitcoin’s UTXO model, making it compatible with formal verification, allowing contracts to be mathematically proven correct before execution.

“Simplicity gives Bitcoin expressive smart contracting power, but without the security problems associated with VM-based chains,” said the Co-Founder and CEO of Blockstream Dr. Adam Back. “It’s built from the ground up to be formally specified, secure, and efficient. With Simplicity, we’re unlocking a wide range of innovative use cases on Bitcoin.”

Simplicity avoids high risk features such as recursion, unbounded loops, and global variables. This design is intended to reduce the potential for bugs and vulnerabilities that have affected other smart contract systems.

The language was first proposed in 2012 by Blockstream engineer Dr. Russell O’Connor and has since been developed by the company’s research team. Blockstream is known for contributing to Bitcoin infrastructure and protocol upgrades, including Taproot.

Simplicity supports several use cases, such as:

Programmable vaults.
Multi-user Bitcoin-native smart banks.
Decentralized exchanges without wrapped assets or global state.
Identity and reputation systems using signed assertions.
Institutional custody setups using B-N signature schemes.
Governance and crowdfunding with static voting rules, recurring payment logic and access-controlled services.
“We designed Simplicity to enable expressive Bitcoin-native applications without inheriting the complexity and fragility of other smart contract ecosystems,” stated the Director of Research at Blockstream Andrew Poelstra. “By combining formal methods with the UTXO model, we’re creating a foundation for secure, programmable finance on Bitcoin that both developers and entities such as financial institutions can depend on.”

The Liquid Network currently has over $3.27 billion in total value locked (TVL), mostly in Bitcoin and issued assets. Simplicity’s integration into this environment aims to provide new tools for organizations looking to build applications within Bitcoin’s ecosystem.

(NASDAQ: CAN) announced the adoption of a formal Cryptocurrency Holding Policy that positions Bitcoin as its core long term reserve asset. The new policy marks a strategic shift in how the company manages its digital assets, aiming to strengthen its financial stability and align more closely with the broader Bitcoin economy.

“The Policy is designed to anchor Canaan’s capital allocation approach firmly within its core competency—the global bitcoin ecosystem—while providing measured flexibility to address operational requirements that may arise from the Company’s self-mining operations, bitcoin mining machine sales, and related crypto-infrastructure initiatives,” commented the chairman and CEO of Canaan Nangeng Zhang. “We believe in the strategic importance of maintaining bitcoin reserves, which reached 1,484 bitcoins as of June 30, 2025.”

According to the company, the policy establishes a structured approach for acquiring, holding, and disposing of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, with a focus on liquidity management, risk tolerance, and long term growth objectives. Under this framework, Bitcoin earned through Canaan’s business operations, such as self-mining and the sale of mining equipment, will generally be held for the long term.

“Canaan believes that a disciplined, long-term BTC reserve position fortifies its balance sheet, aligns the Company with the broader digital asset economy, and provides strategic optionality for future growth,” the company stated.

The policy allows for some flexibility. While Bitcoin will remain the centerpiece of the company’s crypto strategy, Canaan may also acquire other digital assets such as Ethereum or Genius Act–compliant stablecoins. These non-core assets will typically be converted into fiat currency, but may be temporarily held for short to medium term needs related to operations, hedging, or other approved objectives.

By formalizing its Bitcoin holdings, Canaan aims to build a stronger balance sheet, improve strategic optionality, and reinforce its position in the digital asset space. The company sees Bitcoin not only as a reserve asset but also as a hedge against inflation and a long term store of value."

This marks the biggest equity IPO of 2025 so far, according to TD Cowen, which also noted that the structure allows Strategy to continue accumulating Bitcoin without diluting existing common shareholders.

Strategy now holds 607,770 BTC, worth about $80 billion, with a market cap of $114 billion. At the time of writing, MSTR shares trade around $406.5. Nearly all of the $2.47 billion in net proceeds will be used to buy more Bitcoin. At an assumed average price of $120,000 per BTC, Strategy could add over 20,500 BTC to its treasury. 

“By offering a wide assortment of bitcoin‑backed securities designed to appeal to discreet classes of investors, Strategy acts as a funnel for institutional capital flows into Bitcoin,” TD Cowen’s Lance Vitanza and Jonnathan Navarrete wrote in a note to clients. “It’s a sound business model that has attracted many new entrants… no one is likely to match let alone beat Strategy’s cost‑of‑capital advantage.”

The STRC stock offers a variable annual dividend starting at 9%, payable monthly in cash, and is designed to maintain a trading price near its $100 par value. The company retains redemption rights once listed and offers protections like repurchase options and dividend accrual for shareholders.

Strategy continues positioning itself as the institutional gateway to Bitcoin. TD Cowen analysts noted the firm’s cost-of-capital advantage and projected it could add another 17,000 BTC over the next decade without diluting common shareholders.

This move aligns with Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation plan, which includes its 42/42 program targeting $84 billion in capital raised for BTC purchases through 2027. It follows last week’s $740 million Bitcoin buy of 6,220 BTC."
2025-07-25,Does Bitcoin Have Less Than 100 Days Left In This Cycle? - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTFBtV193S2gzUjFnOXo5YkNkamRScER6T2hNaWlPSXN0OEEzbkNCMzVFcnhiaXJHMUNpbE9XR2QzZVMxaHRxT05oLWFoN1lMNEJHckN3eURIZ0N1T1BJNVo0TV82bHNQWG9NclpNdlVXZDBWOEQ4X2E5SFRYYw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With Bitcoin’s price hovering around $120,000, speculation about where we are in the current cycle is intensifying. The data, particularly when mapped against previous cycles, suggests that this bull market could top out within the next three months. But does this hold true, or are there reasons to believe this time truly is different?

The 100-Day Countdown
Viewing the Bitcoin Growth Since Cycle Low chart, we can see that we’re currently around 975 days into the ongoing cycle. For comparison, the 2017 bull market topped out 1,068 days after its cycle began, while the 2021 cycle peaked at 1,059 days. That places us potentially under 100 days from a peak if we’re following historical precedent.

A deeper look into TradingView overlays, aligning both the 2017 and 2021 cycles with the current price action, both earlier cycles entered their parabolic “banana zone” around this same timeframe, resulting in explosive price increases. Averaging the timing between the two would indicate a potential peak around October 19th.

Is This Time Different?
One major counterpoint to this historical view is the magnitude of recent Bitcoin ETF Cumulative Flows. Since January 2024, over 1.2 million BTC have been absorbed by ETFs, with a good portion of that unlikely to return to the market any time soon. This has dramatically altered the supply-demand balance.

In addition to ETFs, Bitcoin treasury companies are sitting on over 870,000 BTC, with that number growing daily. Sovereign holders also account for over 500,000 BTC, and we could still see national strategic reserves that would further tighten supply. When you add in coins held for over 10 years that may be lost (currently around 3.3 million total, so we’ll round down to a very conservative 1.5 million), the potential non-circulating supply exceeds 4 million BTC, or over 20% of the total circulating supply.

Many argue that this cycle is unique due to ETF inflows and institutional adoption, but realistically, this sentiment has echoed in every previous cycle, yet each cycle has ultimately followed a similar trajectory. While current fundamentals are undeniably stronger, assuming a supercycle without hard data remains speculative. Until proven otherwise, history suggests that our traditional 4 year cycles should remain our base case.

October Peak?
Let’s assume for a moment that the cycle does indeed top in October. Is such a sharp move even feasible? Absolutely. When Bitcoin crossed $10,000 in 2017, it doubled in just two weeks. Even this cycle, Bitcoin rallied close to 100% in under 100 days leading up to its $100,000 milestone. Following the ETF approval, BTC surged 80% in just 50 days. Once momentum builds, Bitcoin’s parabolic potential becomes reality fast, and when looking at the MVRV Z-Score, we can see the on-chain data backs this up with similar runups from similar data levels towards market peaks.

Zooming out further, the 200-Week Moving Average recently surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever. More importantly, Bitcoin’s realized price has crossed above the 200-week MA, a rare event that only occurred once before, in November 2020. Back then, BTC rallied by 212% in 90 days.

If we follow even half that trajectory, a 105% gain from current levels would place BTC near $250,000, again, right around mid-October. While it’s risky to base projections on a single historical instance, it’s interesting that this is once again occurring at a very similar stage of the cycle.

Conclusion
Every cycle carries whispers that “this time is different”. And while this cycle has plenty of reasons to believe that could be true, ETF inflows, institutional dominance, sovereign accumulation, etc, the data still points toward a cycle top sometime in Q4 2025. Could we blow past that and enter a true supercycle? Maybe, and I’d love to be proven wrong! But we’ll need evidence before assuming this narrative. For now, the historical cycle blueprint remains our most reliable guide."

If the system facilitates everyone who wants to transact doing so on the blockchain, then the cost for people to verify all of these transactions increases enormously, forcing most people to trust a third party who can afford those costs. If the system maintains a low cost of verification for participants, then everyone who wants to cannot cost effectively transact on the blockchain. 

So we’ll scale Bitcoin with Layer 2s, right? But what does that mean? I’m sure most people reading this hear the word scaling and immediately think purely in terms of transactions per second. The more transactions we can do with bitcoin the asset per second, the more we have scaled, right? 

I would argue no. That is a huge component of it, but that is not the only thing we are trying to scale. We are trying to scale the important properties of Bitcoin as a censorship resistant system. If we didn’t care about that aspect of scaling, we could already call it a day. We have exchanges, banks, and other centralized custodians. 

Trustlessness
We want solutions we build for throughput scalability to preserve trustlessness. Users should not have to depend on the honesty of another party in order to guarantee the security of their funds. Within some constraints users must have the ability to guarantee the ownership of their funds while depending on the action of no party other than themselves.

This doesn’t necessarily mean the same security model as the blockchain, i.e. send your funds to an address and then no other action is required beyond keeping your keys safe. Users might need to stay online, or check in online periodically within some defined time window, or store data that can’t be deterministically regenerated, but they should be capable of unilaterally ensuring that their funds remain in their control. 

Settlement Finality
Users need to have a high degree of certainty that transactions they have conducted are final, and cannot be wound back. This is the entire core function that the blockchain fulfills in the system, processing a transaction and ensuring settlement finality. 

Currently no Layer 2 system actually provides settlement finality off-chain. What they provide is a settlement guarantee backstopped by a third party, such as a federation, custodian, or system operator, or an option to exercise settlement finality when the user wants in the form of pre-signed transactions. 

The theoretically ideal Layer 2 system would provide actual settlement finality itself off-chain. While this might not actually be possible, we should be searching for stronger settlement guarantees provided by third parties, and more flexible and efficient designs for finality “options” in the form of unilateral exit schemes for Layer 2s. 

Cost
We must minimize the cost for users to utilize these systems. This relates very heavily to settlement finality efficiency. If the exercising of a settlement finality option is too expensive, users will opt for systems where they delegate finality guarantees to third parties. 

The cost of using a blockchain is based on how much data your use of it requires. The more data, the more expensive. As blockspace becomes more demanded and fees increase, users must be able to afford to exercise a finality option. 

Liveness Requirements
All current Layer 2s that actually provide an option for settlement finality have some form of liveness requirement, i.e. the user must remain online or get online periodically in order to guarantee the trustless nature and settlement properties of that Layer 2. 

Systems like Lightning require you to be online all the time, use a third party to be online and monitor the blockchain for you, or explicitly trust the people you have channels open with not to try to steal your money with old states. A system like Ark requires you to check in online and rotate your coins because an Ark batch expires and the operator can sweep all funds. 

The only way out of this is to delegate settlement finality and trustless security of funds to a third party. We need to be reducing the liveness requirements as much as possible for systems that do not delegate control to a third party. 

Putting It All Together
Only after we think about these properties that we want to retain while scaling throughput can we actually start to think about the functionalities needed in the Bitcoin protocol itself to facilitate that scaling. 

For current Layer 2s to be trustless, the users themselves must be involved in authorizing balance updates off-chain. This requires users to interact with each other to approve updates. Obviously then, any opcode or change to Bitcoin that would allow users to interact with each other more efficiently and quickly to pre-sign transactions enforcing settlement finality would be beneficial for maintaining trustlessness while scaling. 

To go even further, an opcode that allowed some portion of a UTXO to be freely used by one authorized user, but the rest of the balance remained restricted and only accessible to other users, could maintain trustlessness while doing away with the need for users to all coordinate together at all, or minimize that need to only the starting point of a protocol. 

Thinking about the end result we want, in specific terms of the desired properties we want it to have, is what is necessary to actually scale this protocol in a meaningful way long term. Only then can we take a step back and think about the concrete functionality that the desired end result will need on a technical level. 

To scale Bitcoin is more than just increasing the number of transactions it can process per second. We can do that right now with custodians. To scale Bitcoin is to increase the number of transactions that can occur trustlessly, with censorship resistant finality, without burdensome requirements of liveness placed on the user, and for a cost that a larger set of users can afford. 

If we can’t scale those properties, then Bitcoin hasn’t actually scaled, no matter how many transactions a second are occurring with bitcoin the asset. "

Announced on July 21, 2025, the service targets new construction properties and is facilitated through a strategic partnership with New Estate Only (NEO), a platform specializing in new real estate developments. Additionally, ByteFederal’s collaboration with OPISAS, an international real estate firm, allows foreign investors to purchase U.S. properties with cryptocurrency, expanding access to Florida’s housing market.

The Florida pilot enables buyers to pay security deposits and final closing payments in bitcoin, which ByteFederal converts to USD for escrow or title companies. “We generate a Bitcoin QR code, you make the Bitcoin payment, we handle the conversion, and then we deliver USD fiat to the escrow or title company for closing,” said Paul Tarantino, CEO of ByteFederal, in an interview. The service, currently manual, has a growing waitlist and is set to become fully automated soon. Buyers can fund transactions entirely in bitcoin or combine crypto with fiat, offering flexibility for diverse financial strategies.

ByteFederal’s partnership with NEO leverages the latter’s platform, which serves as a multiple listing service (MLS) for new construction, a market segment traditionally absent from traditional MLS platforms. NEO, venture capital-backed and operational in Florida and Texas, lists properties like single-family homes, townhomes, condos and high-rise apartments. “NEO is the first company to build a big platform for all the new housing and development projects,” Tarantino explained. 

The collaboration with OPISAS targets international investors, particularly from Italy, seeking U.S. real estate. OPISAS facilitates property selection, while ByteFederal handles crypto-to-fiat conversions, ensuring sellers receive USD without exposure to bitcoin’s price volatility. This partnership aligns with growing global interest in U.S. real estate, with NEO planning expansions to Colombia, El Salvador, Italy and Dubai. “They can be going in both directions — someone in the U.S. buying real estate in Colombia or someone in Colombia buying in the U.S.,” Tarantino noted, highlighting the platform’s global potential.

ByteFederal, based in Florida, operates Bitcoin ATMs, offers the ByteWallet and provides ByteConnect, a point-of-sale system for merchants. With 15 money transmitter licenses, the company emphasizes regulatory compliance, positioning itself to benefit from recent U.S. regulatory developments like the Clarity Act, which may provide legal clarity for stablecoins like Tether and Lightning Network transactions. “It’s going to bring a lot of new users into the market who were maybe afraid of it or didn’t feel comfortable stepping in yet,” Tarantino said, referencing the custodial wallet launch planned for September 2025.

This initiative comes amid broader shifts in U.S. financial policy. The Federal Housing Finance Agency is exploring crypto assets for mortgage underwriting, a move that could integrate digital currencies into mainstream finance. ByteFederal’s service addresses key challenges, such as taxation and liquidity, by providing a compliant bridge between crypto and fiat. The company’s focus on new construction and international buyers positions it to capitalize on Florida’s robust real estate market and growing crypto adoption."

The division allows buyers and sellers to complete deals entirely with digital currency, without involving banks.


The new unit, led by the CEO of Christie’s Southern California Aaron Kirman, was created after several major bitcoin and crypto property sales. It includes a team of lawyers, analysts, and crypto experts to manage digital transactions.

This shift comes after several multimillion dollar sales involving bitcoin, including a $65 million property in Beverly Hills where the buyer paid in crypto. Christie’s now lists over $1 billion in homes where sellers are willing to accept bitcoin.

“The trend was obvious — crypto is here to stay,”  said Aaron Kirman, chief executive of a Christie’s subset headquartered in Los Angeles in an interview. “It’s only going to get bigger over the next few years.”

This development comes amid growing federal support for digital assets. President Trump recently signed the Genius Act to regulate stablecoins, and the House passed the Clarity Act aimed at easing restrictions on the crypto industry.

“Accepting cryptocurrency signals an openness to innovative buyers, some of whom are crypto millionaires and billionaires looking for real-world assets to diversify,” said the owner of Invisible House Chris Hanley.

Bitcoin is being used in real estate deals to maintain privacy, often through LLCs funded with bitcoin and crypto. According to Kirman, some sellers never learn the identity of the buyer. Buyers are bypassing banks entirely, using bitcoin as their main form of payment.

“We’ve been really successful at protecting buyer identity,” Mr. Kirman said. “And if my seller feels comfortable not knowing the identity of his buyer, then God bless America.”

Properties now listed for bitcoin include the $118 million La Fin mansion in Bel Air and the Invisible House in Joshua Tree, priced at nearly $18 million. Discussions are also underway with banks to explore bitcoin-backed financing.

In the latest episode of Bitcoin for Corporations, host Pierre Rochard and the CEO of Murano Global Investments, Elías Sacal, explore how Bitcoin is disrupting the traditional real estate investment model."

The move comes as Russia’s central bank has softened its stance on digital assets, recently supporting legislation that allows businesses to use bitcoin and crypto in international trade to bypass Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its conflict in Ukraine.

The executive director of Sberbank Anatoly Pronin said the bank has submitted proposals to the central bank regarding the regulation of bitcoin and crypto assets. He noted that more banks globally are starting to offer custody services, and Sberbank wants to ensure Russia isn’t left behind.

Pronin explained that the bank’s proposals would regulate bitcoin and crypto assets similarly to traditional bank accounts. Sberbank would act as a custodian, guaranteeing the security of tokens and providing safeguards against hacking and unauthorized access. Assets could also be frozen if law enforcement suspects illegal activity.

Custody services are essential for making bitcoin and crypto transactions safer. Gleb Zemskoy, director of blockchain and digital currency development at Insight Finance, emphasized the importance of local custody, saying, “The custodian is the backbone of the world’s economy in terms of cryptocurrencies. And at the moment, it is in the hands of private foreign companies, which indicates a huge risk.”

On June 2, the bank also launched a structured bond linked to the performance of Bitcoin and the USD-to-ruble exchange rate. The product allows qualified investors to earn returns based on BTC price movement and the dollar’s strength. 

“All transactions are processed in rubles within Russia’s legal and infrastructure systems,” Sberbank stated.

Sberbank plans to launch similar structured investments and a Bitcoin futures product through its SberInvestments platform on the Moscow Exchange. These offerings represent one of the first times a major Russian institution has introduced regulated Bitcoin linked products under updated national regulations."
2025-07-16,What If The Magnificent 7 Allocated Just 1% Of Their Cash To Bitcoin? - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxNUXhKclIyeVFzN2loWEJxbkJETzV0UnowX0JMVFU4a3NENlZGU0k3ZF9jcEUtZFNOa3pRY3BFUXRFYlBteFdFdzloNUdGdjB4MU5maE9uZG91YlZsMXdnc0dhWVA5LXlKQkt6M0NhaXhDeVZndVFHY0JaOFQ3NXkwSXVzNWFqUWFzcVJ5SF9TU1ZjbzlnV2JUTDRPVUZReUNWQnh2UDYzWmpuUGtVOFRNQVZkYmhFSWZtWnhGZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I. Introduction: A Shift in Reserve Logic
The largest companies in the world have balance sheets built to weather uncertainty. Their treasuries are designed for stability, liquidity and scale. Traditionally, this has meant holding large reserves of U.S. dollars, government bonds or short-duration instruments.

But today’s economic climate is challenging that orthodoxy. Persistent inflation, negative real yields, geopolitical volatility and growing distrust in long-term monetary policy have turned “safe” assets into a silent liability. The question facing corporate finance leaders is no longer whether to act — it’s when.

And when that action comes from companies like Apple, Microsoft or Amazon, the implications extend far beyond a single quarterly disclosure. Bitcoin’s design makes it uniquely sensitive to high-quality capital inflows. A single move from one of the Magnificent 7 could reprice the entire market.

II. Quantifying the Baseline: A 1% Allocation Scenario
The Magnificent 7 — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla — collectively hold approximately $483 billion in cash and equivalents. If each were to allocate just 1% of their treasury to bitcoin, it would represent $4.83 billion in capital flowing into the asset.

At an assumed Bitcoin price of $120,000, this capital would purchase: 40,258 BTC.

This figure is not abstract. It represents over 89 days of global bitcoin issuance at current mining rates (450 BTC per day). It also accounts for more than 1% of the estimated liquid float available on the market.

These are material numbers — not just because of the dollar amounts involved, but because Bitcoin cannot expand its supply to meet demand. It has no board of governors, no central bank, and no facility to “accommodate” treasury flows. The only variable that can adjust in response to demand is price.

III. Modeling More Aggressive Allocations
What happens if the reallocation rises to 2%? Or 5%?

A 5% allocation would attempt to absorb more than 200,000 BTC — an amount greater than what is mined globally in an entire year. It would also consume over 5% of the liquid float. These conditions would strain market liquidity to the point that price would need to move substantially upward simply to clear the order book.

Bitcoin’s architecture rewards early conviction with more coins per dollar. It penalizes delay with rapidly escalating entry costs.

IV. The Role of Signaling
It is important to recognize that corporate treasury strategy is as much about narrative as it is about numbers. The market does not wait for SEC filings or year-end reports. It responds to intent.

A few well-placed remarks during earnings season — a statement from Alphabet about “assessing non-sovereign assets,” or from Amazon referencing “monetary hedging instruments” — would be sufficient to catalyze capital movement. Traders would front-run the announcement. ETFs would accelerate their inflows. Long-term holders would begin withdrawing from exchanges.

The result is a reflexive loop: The mere suggestion of institutional demand contracts available supply, lifts price and forces others to act more quickly to avoid diminished exposure. This self-reinforcing mechanism is especially powerful when the signal comes from companies that manage hundreds of billions in assets.

Bitcoin is not a stock; there is no issuance curve to smooth capital flow. There is only supply, demand, and an open, permissionless global market that reacts in real time.

V. Peer Dynamics and Strategic Positioning
Tesla’s early entry into bitcoin (11,509 BTC as of today) gives it a significant strategic edge. If another member of the Magnificent 7 were to follow suit — particularly one with an even larger cash position — it would immediately raise questions among the remaining firms.

At that point, the decision not to act would require active justification to shareholders.

Meta, Amazon and Nvidia would no longer be assessing bitcoin in a vacuum. They would be assessing it relative to their peers — peers who are using bitcoin not just as a treasury reserve, but as a signal of long-term thinking and strategic adaptability.

In this way, Bitcoin adoption among the Magnificent 7 would not resemble gradual diffusion. It would behave more like a tipping point.

VI. Treasury Strategy in a Post-Yield World
For companies with strong balance sheets and limited marginal returns on cash, the opportunity cost of doing nothing is rising.

Cash earns negative real returns
Bonds carry reinvestment risk and duration mismatches
Share buybacks have a diminishing impact in a market with declining multiples
International expansion exposes capital to FX volatility and geopolitical risk
Bitcoin offers none of these liabilities.

It is a non-dilutive, non-sovereign, globally liquid asset that can be held without counterparty exposure. It trades 24/7, settles globally, and is immune to the monetary policies of any single government.

In this light, a 1% bitcoin allocation functions less like a bet — and more like insurance.

VII. Conclusion: What Conviction Looks Like at the Top
Bitcoin does not need the entire S&P 500 to adopt it in order to reprice dramatically.

It only needs a small number of credible actors — those with the capital, visibility, and influence to reshape the narrative and flow.

The Magnificent 7 are uniquely positioned to play this role. With a combined $483 billion in idle cash, even a minor reallocation would have outsized impact on Bitcoin’s market structure.

And once that signal is sent — through words, filings or visible capital flows — the window for low-cost entry closes quickly. Because in bitcoin, the supply never increases.

Only the price does."
2025-07-15,Inside Cantor Fitzgerald’s $4B Bitcoin Treasury Deal With Blockstream - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxQNEdQWkRWZFhYWmNCSk10SzVzWUZ0cGp0RG04Qkx1S0VjZHBldXZ6T0dXU2VOaktLSENUZmxDaHVkckN0bnNHbU02TDZ3bHFzNS1TRW53WmNfaDZmWWh1VnRicGplSUJZbFdrcURINFgtZnFvdlRvVU5zWTZRUXRNbGt0eUFWQlVTbzlaT09VUWNaQ1g3Z3pCWF9qV1RLM1lvV1dRZVp6WkRLTWdHYjJIRDU0b1hveWdtb21oLQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article represents Bitcoin For Corporations’ perspective. Please read our news article if you’re looking for complete detailed coverage.

Something is changing in the capital markets—and it’s not subtle. This week, Cantor Fitzgerald advanced what may become one of the largest Bitcoin treasury moves to date, solidifying its position as one of the most aggressive institutional Bitcoin buyers in the world.

The deal: a $4 billion special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) combining with Blockstream Capital, the trading and investment arm of Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream. As part of the deal, Blockstream Capital—co-founded by early Bitcoin contributor Adam Back—is expected to contribute over 30,000 BTC in exchange for equity in a newly formed entity, BSTR Holdings. An additional $800 million in outside capital is also being raised to scale the strategy further.

This isn’t just another crypto-adjacent corporate deal. It’s a sophisticated, multi-layered move that marks a deeper evolution: the rise of purpose-built public companies structured entirely around Bitcoin.

The Rise of Bitcoin-Native Public Vehicles
The Cantor–Blockstream transaction is part of a broader trend we call Bitcoin-native capital formation—where equity, debt, and structured products are engineered to maximize Bitcoin per share, not just earnings per share. These aren’t companies that simply “believe” in Bitcoin. They are designed around it.

What began with Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has now taken root in markets around the world:
• Metaplanet in Tokyo
• The Blockchain Group in Paris
• The Smarter Web Company in London
• Semler Scientific in the U.S.
• And now Cantor Fitzgerald, with Wall Street firepower

These firms are deploying playbooks that resemble private equity—but with Bitcoin as the foundational capital asset. Instead of waiting for ETF flows or incremental adoption, they’re rewriting the rules of corporate finance by acquiring Bitcoin directly through public vehicles.

Why This Deal Is Different
There’s a reason this one stands out.

This isn’t a treasury team allocating 1% of idle cash to Bitcoin. This is a premier U.S. brokerage—helmed by 27-year-old Brandon Lutnick—leveraging SPAC infrastructure to execute a generational bet on Bitcoin at scale. Lutnick, who became chair of Cantor Fitzgerald this year after his father was appointed U.S. Commerce Secretary, is now orchestrating multi-billion-dollar Bitcoin transactions from the front lines of traditional finance.

The $4B Blockstream Capital deal follows another $3.6B crypto-buying venture Lutnick struck earlier this year with SoftBank and Tether. Together, these deals could push Cantor’s 2025 Bitcoin acquisitions near $10 billion.

That level of exposure isn’t a hedge—it’s a posture.

And the structure matters:
→ Bitcoin is being contributed in-kind in exchange for equity, creating alignment between issuer and shareholder.
→ Outside capital is being raised not for product development or burn, but to accumulate Bitcoin on a schedule.
→ The vehicle itself—BSTR Holdings—is being shaped as a modern Bitcoin treasury company.

Adam Back’s Expanding Footprint
This is also the latest move in Adam Back’s increasingly active role as a backer of Bitcoin treasury companies. Beyond Blockstream Capital’s participation in this deal, Back has personally invested in two other Bitcoin-native public firms this year:
• The Blockchain Group in France, where he participated in multiple equity raises
• H100 Group in Sweden, where he funded multiple raises

Back’s fingerprints are increasingly visible in this emerging class of companies that treat Bitcoin not just as an asset, but as infrastructure.

The Bigger Picture for Corporations
The significance isn’t limited to Cantor or Blockstream. What we’re witnessing is the rapid emergence of a new class of public company—one that treats Bitcoin not as a balance sheet curiosity, but as the core operating logic of the business.

For corporate leaders watching from the sidelines, the signal is clear: capital markets are repricing strategic positioning around Bitcoin. And they’re doing it with speed, structure, and scale.

At BFC, we believe the companies that move early—using thoughtful, transparent structures—won’t just benefit from asset appreciation. They’ll earn a premium for vision and execution.

Cantor’s SPAC strategy is more than a headline. It’s a marker of what’s coming next."
2025-07-14,The Blockspace Market: A Darwinian Forge - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxQR3M4VS01S3FKR0p4a3ptMGcwYTEzcXlMNFNTaTdtRVNtNVd6Rlp1MzNnX1VFdTRWR0J1NmxkQjh2cUJkN3hMOGNpVFhYSzRKX0VpVEoxNV8wY2YzdTFTcHh6VzBidkxOdlNHbWpKVGpOSzVlYkVBY0llYWl6ZTlxTGYwaw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bitcoin is a decentralized and censorship-resistant network built around independent participants maintaining and verifying their own copy of the database, storing its historical transaction record. 

Its entire purpose for existing is to function in a manner that prevents anyone from being shut out of the system, or prevented from using it. That is its raison d’être.

People will use Bitcoin for things that it wasn’t intended for, or things that some people disapprove of, or some things that almost everyone will agree is abhorrent. These things will happen because Bitcoin works, you can’t stop people from using it. 

The entire conversation around this reality in the last year or so hasn’t even really touched on the core dynamics of competing use cases, it has just been an argument between people advocating trying to stop people from using Bitcoin in certain ways, and people explaining the futility of that. There is an inescapable underlying reality that the entire discourse, debate, or whatever you want to call it, is almost entirely ignoring: there are different use cases for blockspace, with different needs of blockspace, and these all compete with each other. 

That is writ large. 

So what do we do about that? There is nothing to do but adapt. Blockspace is a competitive free market, it is Darwinian. Different use cases are very much like organisms, existing in an environment called the blockspace market. Like all environments, it can change and become dominated by new conditions. Anomalous and extreme events or changes in that environment can occur. It’s a dynamic system. 

Like any organism in any changing or dynamic environment, use cases must adapt to those changes. 

Blockspace Density
One of the core considerations when it comes to a use case adapting is density. How “dense” can a single use case’s utilization of blockspace be? 

To put another way, how much can you compress the transactions required to fulfill a certain use case in order to minimize the blockspace required, and therefore the cost required. Means of exchange as a use case is a good example to start with. When Bitcoin was first launched, a single transaction, or exchange, required a single on-chain transaction in order to facilitate. Each and every economic exchange required one transaction’s worth of blockspace. 

That is no longer the case, because the “density” of Bitcoin’s use as a means of exchange increased dramatically with the introduction of off-chain accounting mechanisms. This includes everything from custodial ledgers like ChangeTip (an old tipping service), Coinbase, and Wallet of Satoshi, to decentralized and self-custodial tools like the Lightning Network, Ark, and other Layer 2 designs. The efficiency of Bitcoin as a means of exchange has increased by orders of magnitude compared to Bitcoin’s early days. The amount of blockspace necessary to meet this use case is orders of magnitude less than what it used to be. 

Let’s look at another use case, timestamping. Bitcoin is incredibly useful in this regard, by embedding a piece of data (or a hash of said data) into the blockchain, the existence of any digital file at the time it is confirmed can be proven thermodynamically beyond the shadow of a doubt. In the early days of the network, people used to include the hashes of every individual file being timestamped in an OP_RETURN of a single transaction. One transaction = one file timestamped. 

That is clearly not very dense at all, and not very scalable. Opentimestamps changed this. Rather than make an individual transaction for each file to be timestamped, Opentimestamps introduced the concept of a “calendar server” that would accept numerous file hashes to be timestamped, and construct a merkle tree including all of them. A single transaction can now timestamp an infinite number of file hashes. 

This was demonstrated by Opentimestamps creator Peter Todd in 2017, when he timestamped the entirety of the contents of the Internet Archive. That included over 750 million files, all thermodynamically attested to with a single transaction. If the density of the means of exchange use can be viewed as equivalent to a neutron star, an extremely dense stellar body, timestamping is the equivalent of the largest blackhole in the universe. 

Let’s look at a final use case example, inscriptions. This use case utilizes blockspace in order to not just prove the existence of a piece of data at a certain point in time, but to make use of the Bitcoin blockchain in order to ensure that piece of data remains available to all who want it by counting on the incentives of the network to ensure the blockchain in its entirety remains available. 

This use case has been made marginally denser. Ord, the ordinals and inscription client, has implemented compression algorithms for different types of data such as text and pictures. This however can only go so far, as the laws of information theory show that information can only be compressed so far without destroying information in the process. Trying to compress data beyond this limit renders such data irrecoverable. 

Other NFT projects have tried to get inventive to circumvent this limitation, inscribing individual pieces of art such as body outlines, facial features, etc. and using small snippets of code to programmatically generate individual NFT images from these pieces. But that again can only go so far. 

This is a use case that, given its entire purpose is to write the data itself directly to the blockchain in order to guarantee its durable availability, cannot be made denser to the same degree things like means of exchange use or timestamping can be. 

Trust Models
One of the inescapable realities of increasing the density of blockspace use for individual use cases is the implications that has for any given use case’s trust model. 

Looking at the means of exchange use case is the clearest example of this. Making a transaction on-chain is as trustless as a bitcoin transaction can be. A user can be in total control of their own funds, with no restrictions whatsoever on their use except the need to pay for blockspace. The denser you make transactional use, i.e., the more transactions you try to facilitate off-chain, the more you introduce new restrictions or trust requirements. 

To transact on the Lightning Network means your coins must be locked into a payment channel. This subjects your funds to the liquidity requirements of the Lightning Network. Are funds available in other channels to route a payment to your intended destination? It also subjects your funds to time restrictions in the worst case scenario. If your channel counterparty is unresponsive, you must wait through a timelock in order to claim back unilateral control of your funds. It also introduces the responsibility to keep more data secure. If your channel state data is lost, access to your funds can be lost forever. Unlike mnemonic seeds, this data cannot simply be “regenerated” from a static one time backup. 

Custodial systems are yet another different set of restrictions and trust trade offs. You might not be subject to liquidity requirements like on Lightning, but you must now completely trust your custodian. In order to transact, their permission is required. In order to claim back your money through a “less dense” mechanism, their permission is required. Everything you want to do with your funds requires that custodian’s permission. 

Timestamping is a relatively easy thing here. The only change with more dense mechanisms like Opentimestamps is the need to store extra data, the merkle proof connecting the timestamp to the blockchain. Other than that, there are no fundamental differences, and the trust model of Opentimestamps is the same as directly timestamping a single file. It proves that file existed at that time, and nothing else. 

Inscription’s trust model is essentially destroyed by attempting to maximally increase the use case density, i.e., storing files entirely off-chain. It is simply not possible to increase the density of this use case beyond the marginal improvements already made on-chain without completely destroying the trust model the entire use case is predicated on in the first place. 

Demand Elasticity and Scaling
If each use case is to be looked at like an organism in a Darwinian environment, each use case’s ability to tolerate higher fees is the equivalent of an organism’s ability to adapt to a new environment. 

If a use case can’t pay higher fees when the blockspace market gets more competitive, then it effectively dies. It becomes an evolutionary dead end. There are only two ways that a use case can adapt to a higher environment, either users just suck it up and pay the higher fees, or some mechanism is found for distributing fees amongst multiple users so that the individual cost is still bearable. 

For transactional use cases, this necessitates facilitating more users being able to coordinate to share control of a single on-chain coin, and importantly having a cost effective mechanism for enforcing their share of ownership on-chain if necessary. The Lightning Network, and now soon Ark, have made massive progress in this direction. But it is nowhere near enough to increase blockspace density to the point where it can handle global use at scale without defaulting to most people using custodians. 

That denies Bitcoin’s most important properties to most means of exchange users at scale. There is still a lot of work to be done in order to increase this use case’s density enough to bring censorship resistance to the masses. 

Timestamping has already solved this problem as efficiently as it can be solved. A merkle tree is unbounded in size, and can commit to an infinite number of hashes. This means that an infinite number of users can collaborate to bear the cost of the single transaction necessary to timestamp everything. 

Inscriptions cannot really adapt in the same way as the other two. While many users could collaborate in order to share the cost of inscribing data, this isn’t practical for many use cases. That might work if the goal is to inscribe some politically or socially relevant information, such as sensitive data leaks from government or corporate databases, but this is not the primary use case for Inscriptions. NFTs and other speculative assets are. 

It makes no sense for a large group to share the cost of inscribing NFT data if only one person can “own” the resulting NFT. You could potentially share ownership with schemes like multisig, but this would be a complete evolution of the use case itself, not simply how the use case is facilitated. At the end of the day someone inscribing an NFT to sell must sell it for more than the cost to inscribe it. Otherwise they are losing money. 

This will have an impact on the demand for such assets, and as such Inscriptions are decidedly at a disadvantage to other use cases in this respect. 

Adapt or Die
You cannot stop people from using Bitcoin, even if you don’t like how they are using it. If you could, then Bitcoin would be a failed project that cannot even deliver on one its core value propositions: censorship resistance. 

This is just the reality of how it works. Conversations around how to stop certain use cases, or users, is an exercise in futility, and quite frankly a comedy show. It completely ignores the reality of what Bitcoin is, how it works, and the underlying fundamental dynamics of multiple use cases existing together in a competitive system built around a scarce resource: blockspace. 

It should be very clear that means of exchange as a use case has a decided advantage over a use case like Inscriptions in almost every way. It can be made denser, it can scale further while keeping more of its ideal trust model intact, and its demand is much more inelastic. If bitcoin’s desirability as a means of exchange faded, then Bitcoin as a system in its entirety would fade. Even just buying and selling the asset is a use as a means of exchange, it is being exchanged for fiat. 

It is the primary use case, and for it not to be means that demand for bitcoin in general has failed to materialize to a sustainable level. That is clearly not the case. 

Conversations around different use cases of Bitcoin should be focused on a single thing: how to increase the density of a use case, while maintaining the properties of its ideal trust model, to remain competitive with others in the market for blockspace. 

If we want bitcoin to become a primary means of exchange, a global money, then this is necessary. Its density must increase, and its competitiveness must be maintained. Users who engage in other use cases can worry about those themselves, but all of us must be concerned with the competitiveness of the use case of means of exchange. 

That is, unless you’re cheering on Bitcoin to win a Darwin Award."
2025-07-10,Bitcoin Layer 2: Sidechains - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTFBQcHYzNFdjeWxCbklKVGNmc3lVdVJEQWJiTVQwOGlYMUh3c2U0dE5aU0xWaXQ2WWVwWExBSEpYLUxKNUo0dGZpeTBOQ0NnZllBbFJJekd4WFpCbzlCWXVHTkVsT3cxTldLMmpVMTQ3UHprZw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The original concept of a Bitcoin sidechain was proposed by Adam Back, Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Mark Friedenbach, Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Miller, Andrew Poelstra, Jorge Timón, and Pieter Wuille, who all went on to found Blockstream, in 2014. 

The idea was proposed to allow a more liberal development environment, where people could try new ideas and technologies on a sidechain without risking the security of the main Bitcoin blockchain. 

Since then the design space of sidechains has grown rather large. 

At the end of the day sidechains is a very broad term that encompasses a large range of very diverse and different systems. They can be as varied and arbitrary as the entire ecosystem of altcoins and other blockchains can be. That is after all what they are, other blockchain systems. 

Regardless of the specific designs of any given sidechain, they have two primary components: a peg, and a consensus mechanism and rules. The peg functions as the vehicle for “locking” and “unlocking” coins on the mainchain to move them back and forth between Bitcoin’s base layer and the sidechain. The consensus mechanism and rules are how the sidechain itself functions, i.e. how new blocks are created, and the rules for what behaviors and transactions or contracts are allowed. 

These are the necessary pieces for a sidechain. 

The Original Proposal
The 2014 Blockstream design proposed the use of merge mining for a consensus mechanism, reusing the work from current Bitcoin miners by having sidechain blockheaders be committed indirectly in the mainchain blockheader, and Simplified Payment Verification proofs (SPV proofs) in order to operate the peg mechanism. 

To facilitate merge mining, all sidechains would construct their blockheader as a “subheader” committed to in the coinbase transaction of a mainchain block. This would allow all miners to simultaneously mine the mainchain as well as whatever sidechains they choose to commit to. Any mainchain blockheader that meets a sidechain difficulty target, even if it does not meet the target for the mainchain, can be submitted to the sidechain network as a valid block. 

Pegging required merkle proofs showing that certain transactions were included in a block. The proposed peg mechanism could work one of two ways, using symmetric SPV proofs, or asymmetric SPV proofs. 

The symmetric scheme would require SPV proofs of both deposits and withdrawals, with a contest period. To deposit, users would need to send coins to a script on the mainchain that could only be spent by producing an SPV proof. After waiting for the contest period to elapse, the user could unlock coins on the sidechain with an SPV proof that they have deposited coins to the sidechain script on the mainchain. Any proof that a reorg with more work has occurred on the mainchain that undid the deposit transaction can be used to invalidate the claim transaction on the sidechain, and every sidechain user would have an incentive to produce that proof to prevent the peg from losing 1:1 backing. 

Withdrawals would require the inverse, locking sidechain coins in a script requiring SPV proofs from the mainchain to unlock. After waiting for the contest period to elapse, the user can then unlock coins on the mainchain using an SPV proof that they locked coins on the sidechain. 

The asymmetric variant does away with the need to produce SPV proofs of the mainchain for deposits by requiring sidechain nodes to also run and verify the mainchain by consensus. This would allow for faster and more secure deposits, but increase the validation costs of a sidechain. 

While merge mining has been deployed for numerous sidechains, as well as completely independent altcoin networks, the SPV peg proposed in the original paper, and the needed consensus changes to Bitcoin, have never been implemented or deployed. 

The Appendix – Federated Pegs & Other Designs
In the Appendix A to the original paper, the authors proposed in lieu of (or until) the softfork necessary to implement their SPV peg design the use of a federated peg. The proposal was to use a multisig of functionaries to operate the peg, custodying users coins while used on the sidechain and enforcing the validity of withdrawals. This was done with the implementation of Liquid, which also used the functionaries to sign blocks for the sidechain with cryptographic keys, and Rootstock, which made use of merged mining for sidechain consensus. 

Since the launch of these sidechains, there have been numerous other design proposals for different sidechain consensus mechanisms, as well as different sidechain peg mechanisms. While many of them have been deployed, not all of them have, and none of them have truly achieved any serious level of adoption. 

Below are links to a previous article series I have written looking at the different aspects of other proposed sidechain designs. While this series is not entirely complete, it includes most of the biggest proposals. "

The game, SaruTobi, now enables real-money in-app payments using ZBD’s Bitcoin Lightning technology—marking a shift in Apple’s historically closed approach to alternative payment systems.

This approval follows regulatory pressure from the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) and recent legal rulings like Epic v. Apple, which have forced tech giants to open up their platforms to more flexible and developer-friendly payment methods. 

Originally launched in 2013, SaruTobi was once removed from the App Store for its early Bitcoin integration. Now, more than a decade later, the game returns to iOS fully powered by ZBD’s fast, low-cost Lightning infrastructure—a new era of seamless, programmable, and borderless payments. 

“Apple’s approval of Bitcoin microtransactions in SaruTobi is a historic shift,” said André Neves, Co-Founder and CTO of ZBD. “The tech for open, developer-driven payments has existed for a while. What’s changed is the regulatory environment which has cracked open the gates. By integrating Lightning directly into the game, we’ve created a frictionless experience that gives players new ways to engage, spend, and earn value.”

Unlike traditional in-app purchases that are often constrained by rigid pricing tiers and high platform fees, Bitcoin microtransactions allow for ultra-flexible payment mechanics. In SaruTobi, players can spend just a few cents to retry a level or unlock power-ups, with payments settling instantly—without interrupting gameplay.

The model also supports rewarded gameplay. Players earn sats (small units of Bitcoin) through in-game actions and can use them to purchase upgrades or boosts within the app, attempting to create a self-sustaining microeconomy that encourages deeper engagement.

“With Bitcoin, developers can now create payments that are instant, programmable, and borderless down to the cent or less,” Neves added. “This isn’t just about payments. It’s about rewriting how games monetize, engage, and grow.” 

With SaruTobi now live on iOS, this approval may pave the way for more Bitcoin-native experiences across the App Store in the near future. "
2025-07-08,Bitcoin Showed Up In DC — And Washington Took Notice - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOYmV4cktWX2xwbjBsNnVzcWdQMUFucEhWQWw5U0E2U3FWd1RUVnU4WnVaVUU0bUI0VkV1NV8yMGVVNktsZVc4Z3VlNlBDYlRoQnkwa1RaTE82SENud2swQ3A4U3p5b21kbkl2UnVSMGxJcEVMenJydEQ0WThabWpnZVA0TklDOEhNT3NzdXRnOU0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Zack Cohen, Bitcoin Policy Institute

Before diving into the recap, I want to say thank you. On behalf of the entire team at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, thank you to everyone who attended, supported, spoke, tuned in, or participated in any way. We spent months preparing for our third Bitcoin Policy Summit. What unfolded in Washington last week exceeded anything we could have expected.

More than 1,000 people joined us: builders, policymakers, students, agency staff, journalists, energy experts, and human rights advocates. And what they found was not a party dressed up as a conference, but a serious two-day working session that reflected how far the Bitcoin conversation has come – and where it’s going.

Bitcoin has long been misunderstood or sidelined in DC. It’s been easy for policymakers to dismiss or ignore it. But the 2025 Summit sent a different signal: Bitcoin isn’t going away. It’s not on the fringe. It’s at the center of emerging conversations about national strategy, economic strength, digital rights, and innovation.

A Welcome That Set the Tone
We opened the week with a packed welcome party, co-hosted with our friends at PubKey. To outsiders, DC may seem like a rigid town — buttoned-up, formal, slow-moving. But if you spend real time here, you know the truth: DC runs on relationships. And relationships are built in places like this.

Over 450 attendees gathered in a room buzzing with live karaoke, strong cocktails (shoutout to Unchained for devising the Old Fashioned Bull Run and the Miner’s Mule), and constant conversation. It was loud. It was joyful. But most of all, it was serious energy. Bitcoiners had arrived.

Who Was in the Room
This year’s summit brought in:

1,000+ total attendees
300+ public policy professionals
35 congressional offices, including 12 members of Congress
100+ federal government employees
50+ members of the press
49 universities
90,000+ livestream viewers
Attendees included national security experts, financial regulators, think tank analysts, open-source developers, nonprofit leaders, and more. Bitcoin’s coalition is broadening, and it showed.

What We Talked About
The program was structured around clear themes: national security, energy, privacy, financial inclusion, and legislative strategy. Keynotes, panels, and lightning talks made space for both technical depth and broad vision.

In the opening segment, Zack Shapiro outlined BPI’s national strategy framework — a vision of American Bitcoin leadership grounded in open-source values, resilience, and forward-looking policy. That was followed by a sharp panel on Senate priorities, including the BITCOIN Act.

Alex Leishman gave a data-rich talk on the American Bitcoin advantage — why our institutions, capital markets, and rule of law position the US to lead. Alex Gladstein brought the human rights lens to life, reminding the room that Bitcoin is still the most powerful freedom technology of the 21st century.

Patrick Witt, Deputy Director of the President’s Council on Digital Assets, reiterated the administration’s strategic interest in Bitcoin, highlighting ongoing progress:

“There will be the forthcoming report on the interagency activities. We’ve already taken some steps with the SPR. The question now is, how do we follow that up with an accumulation plan? There’s no shortage of opportunities and work to be done. So after we leave here, I’ll get right back to it.”

Two democrats, Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) and Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) joined Bitcoin Core’s 10th known developer Matt Corallo and BPI Co-president Grant McCarty to discuss the need for making the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act bipartisan. 

At one point during the panel, Rep. Torres remarked, 

“The value of Bitcoin is more secure than the value of gold because you can always find more gold, but the supply of Bitcoin in the world is going to remain fixed in perpetuity.”

Rep. Gottheimer, who recently signed on as a co-sponsor of the bill, joined Rep. Torres on stage to explain his decision to co-sponsor the bill and underscore the importance of protecting innovators and preserving the integrity of the open-source development ecosystem.


In one of the most high-impact sessions, BPI’s Zack Shapiro sat down with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce to discuss ETF structure, qualified custody, and what the future of Bitcoin-native financial infrastructure might look like. It was detailed, honest, and substantive — exactly what this moment calls for.

Office Hours and the Q&A Room
New this year, we introduced structured office hours: one-on-one sessions where attendees could sit down with our research fellows. These conversations dug into mining, privacy, regulation, and monetary strategy in an unfiltered setting.

The Q&A Room added another layer of depth. Cygnal CEO Brent Buchanan walked through a recent poll of 800 likely midterm voters. The findings were clear: Bitcoiners are becoming a political constituency. Ignore them at your own risk.

Anna Chekhovich also led a foundational Bitcoin 101 session for policymakers, breaking down the basics of Bitcoin in plain language, rooted in her global human rights work.

Bitcoin on the Hill

BPI’s Day on the Hill marked the largest coordinated effort to date of Bitcoin advocates engaging directly with lawmakers. Over 120 attendees participated in 118 confirmed meetings with congressional offices:

48 Senate offices
70 House offices
Over 10 meetings at the member level
Offices from 68 Democrats and 50 Republicans
Representation from 28 states, DC, and a U.S. territory
This wasn’t performative. It was strategic. For many in Congress, these were the first real conversations they’d had with serious, mission-driven Bitcoin advocates.

Reflections
What stood out this year was the tone. Bitcoiners came dressed in suits. Not as a costume, but as a signal. We came to engage seriously. The excitement in the room wasn’t hype — it was grounded in focus, preparation, and a shared sense that this moment mattered.

And DC responded. Policymakers and staff weren’t just open, they were engaged. They asked good questions. They listened. The distance between Bitcoin and Washington is shrinking, fast.

Personally, the most striking realization was that Gen Z had shown up in force. It wasn’t just the number of young people in the room—it was their presence. They were engaged, sharp, curious, and genuinely excited to be part of the conversation. I’ve been to more conferences than I can count, and this was the first time it felt like my peers weren’t watching from the sidelines. They were in it—asking questions, driving dialogue, shaping the future. And best of all, we’re only just getting started.

This Is Only the Beginning
The Bitcoin Policy Institute is uniquely positioned to host a summit that answers to no one but its mission. Bitcoin isn’t asking for special treatment. It’s not lobbying for handouts. It’s making a case, on the merits, for why it matters to American sovereignty, innovation, and economic freedom.

That case just got a lot harder to ignore.

See you next year."

Spark is a system based on statechains (explainer article there). Statechains don’t have the most clear cut trust model. Spark is essentially the channel factory version of statechains, with numerous statechains nested inside of a transaction tree built on a single on-chain UTXO. 

Statechains are a Layer 2 system that allow entire UTXOs to be freely transferred off-chain with no liquidity constraints, but with the requirement of accepting some trust tradeoffs. You must trust that an operator, the service provider essentially, will delete private key material every time the statechain is transferred. 

So let’s look at what makes something noncustodial. 

A user has unilateral control over their funds, or the ability to regain it. 
No other party (or parties) has the ability to prevent the user from spending their funds, or regaining their ability to, or to spend them without the involvement of the user. 
The first quality definitively applies to statechains. Just like a Lightning channel a user has the ability to use a pre-signed transaction to reclaim their funds after a timelock period to ensure honest settlement. The second quality isn’t so clear cut in terms of applying or not applying. 

The statechain protocol requires the operator and original user to collaboratively generate a key that neither party ever has full knowledge of. Using their shares they can collaborate to pre-sign the users withdrawal transaction. When the original user transfers it to someone else, the original user, new user, and operator all collaborate to “regenerate” the same key but with a different set of shares between the new user and operator. 

After signing the new user’s withdrawal transaction, the operator is then supposed to delete the share they generated with the original users. This prevents the operator from ever signing a new transaction with the original user, and the shorter timelock on the new user’s transaction guarantees that they can spend theirs before the original user can spend his. 

If the operator does not delete old key shares, then it would be possible for them to collaborate with any past user who kept their key share to steal the funds in the statechain.

The Operator
If the operator is doing what they are supposed to and deleting their old key shares every time the statechain is transferred, they are not a custodial system. They physically are incapable of signing any transactions in collaboration with anyone except the current and rightful owner of the statechain. The pre-signed transactions decrementing timelock guarantees that the current owner can always confirm their withdrawal transaction before any previous owner. 

Operators can even run their software in an SGX enclave or other secure computing environment, and have the enclave enforce the correct behavior of the software. It can even provide proofs (granted you trust the environment to not be broken) of this that others can verify. 

They also have a strong incentive to operate the protocol honestly, because in doing so they are not required to comply with the regulations that come along with being a custodial service holding other people’s money. 

The Users
End users have a unilateral withdrawal transaction. This can be used any time after the timelock for their ownership expires and before the timelock for the previous owners time window expires. If the operator stops responding or disappears, they have this option. 

But they have to trust that the operator is operating the protocol honestly, and deleting past key shares. There is no way for them to really verify that. As mentioned above, something like the SGX enclave could handle security for the operator’s software and sign proofs it is running honest software. But all that is doing is moving the point of trust away from the operator and onto Intel, the makers of the SGX enclave. 

Even when dealing with a truly honest operator, who has only ever run honest software and never cheated a single user, a user can never actually know that they are an honest operator. They can only see that the operator has been honest, and hope they will continue to be. 

So….?
There is no real clear cut answer. In the situation where an operator is actually being honest, it fits all the criteria I laid out above to be noncustodial. The user has an unimpeded ability to gain full access to their funds, and no one else is able to stop them from doing that or steal their funds. 

The problem is that it isn’t verifiable. 

There is no way to trustlessly verify as a user that you have trustless control over your funds. Even if you actually do. 

So there is a problem with labeling it as noncustodial, because even if it is it is not possible for a user to ever truly verify it. But there is also a problem with calling it custodial, because the operator cannot do anything to move funds without collaborating with another user and the current user has a unilateral withdrawal transaction. This creates a dilemma in terms of categorizing tools in the space. 

I don’t know what the solution is, but the first step I think is acknowledging the technical realities occurring before jumping to label things one way or another (why not a new category?) because of your own incentives. These types of questions, especially in an environment of glacially slow Bitcoin protocol changes, will become more frequent as developers struggle with the trade offs of Bitcoin’s current limitations.

Bitcoin is a programmable money, and the ways people will program it won’t always fit neatly into our predefined boxes. "

As liquidity increases, so does the capital available to flow into risk-on assets, such as Bitcoin. However, in this evolving market landscape, a more responsive and perhaps even more accurate metric has emerged, one that not only correlates highly with BTC price action but is also specific to the ecosystem.

Global M2
Let’s begin with the Global M2 vs BTC chart. This has been one of the most shared and analyzed charts on Bitcoin Magazine Pro throughout the current bull cycle, and for good reason. The M2 supply encompasses all physical currency and near-money assets in an economy. When aggregated globally across major economies, it paints a clear picture of fiscal stimulus and central bank behavior.

Historically, major expansions in M2, especially those driven by money printing and fiscal interventions, have coincided with explosive Bitcoin rallies. The 2020 bull run was a textbook example. Trillions in stimulus flooded global economies, and Bitcoin surged from the low thousands to over $60,000. A similar pattern occurred in 2016-2017, and conversely, periods like 2018-2019 and 2022 saw M2 contraction aligning with BTC bear markets.

A Stronger Correlation
However, while the raw M2 chart is compelling, viewing Global M2 vs BTC Year-on-Year provides a more actionable view. Governments tend to always print money, so the base M2 supply nearly always trends upward. But the rate of acceleration or deceleration tells a different story. When the year-over-year growth rate of M2 is rising, Bitcoin tends to rally. When it’s falling or negative, Bitcoin typically struggles. This trend, despite short-term noise, highlights the deep connection between fiat liquidity expansion and Bitcoin’s bullishness.

But there’s a caveat: M2 data is slow. It takes time to collect, update, and reflect across economies. And the impact of increased liquidity doesn’t hit Bitcoin immediately. Initially, new liquidity flows into safer assets like bonds and gold, then equities, and only later into higher volatility, speculative assets like BTC. This lag is crucial for timing strategies. We can add a delay onto this data, but the point remains.

Stablecoins
To address this latency, we pivot to a more timely and crypto-native metric: stablecoin liquidity. Comparing BTC to the supply of major stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI, etc.) reveals an even stronger correlation than with M2.

Now, just tracking the raw value of stablecoin supply offers some value, but to truly gain an edge, we examine the rate of change, particularly over a 28-day (monthly) rolling basis. This change in supply is highly indicative of short-term liquidity trends. When the rate turns positive, it often marks the beginning of new BTC accumulation phases. When it turns sharply negative, it aligns with local tops and retracements.

Looking back at the tail end of 2024, as stablecoin growth spiked, BTC surged from prolonged consolidation into new highs. Similarly, the major 30% drawdown earlier this year was preceded by a steep negative turn in stablecoin supply growth. These moves were tracked to the day by this metric. Even more recent rebounds in stablecoin supply are starting to show early signs of a potential bounce in BTC price, suggesting renewed inflows into the crypto markets.

Figure 5: In the past, the indicator triggered by the liquidity rate crossing above zero has been a reliable buy signal.

The value of this data isn’t new. Crypto veterans will remember Tether Printer accounts on Twitter dating back to 2017, watching every USDT mint as a signal for Bitcoin pumps. The difference now is we can measure this more precisely, in real-time, and with the added nuance of rate-of-change analysis. What makes this even more powerful is the intracycle and even intraday tracking capabilities. Unlike the Global M2 chart, which updates infrequently, stablecoin liquidity data can be tracked live and used on short timeframes, and when tracking for positive shifts in this change, it can provide great accumulation opportunities.

Conclusion
While Global M2 growth aligns with long-term Bitcoin trends, the stablecoin rate-of-change metric provides clarity for intra-cycle positioning. It deserves a spot in every analyst’s toolkit. Using a simple strategy, such as looking for crossovers above zero in the 28-day rate of change for accumulation, and considering scaling out when extreme spikes occur, has worked remarkably well and will likely continue to do so."
2025-07-03,The Nakamoto Strategy: Seeding Bitcoin Treasury Companies In Every Capital Market - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPX25oaGNVSXJaWEJoQm5McHlTU0ZfZnpTZURDWE1FdkpNNnRMTThwSThWeEtfelJ5dXRLa0tscWpmUWtQMF9ha2pKSUZjNEZRTDVmN3JHT1RESkJoU0w5S0dlVVdhNWotcU9kcTFGdTlvQVpZeE9saTMtOGwxYmNJUmVR?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Introduction: From Treasury Strategy to Global Bitcoin Refinery
The Nakamoto strategy offers a new framework for capital formation in the age of Bitcoin. Rather than viewing Bitcoin solely as a reserve asset, Nakamoto is pursuing an approach that uses Bitcoin as a foundation for constructing a more dynamic and globally integrated capital structure.

The strategy involves more than simply accumulating BTC on a balance sheet. Nakamoto treats Bitcoin as a base layer of value and pairs it with public equity as a leverage layer—strategically deploying capital into smaller, high-potential public companies. The goal is to compound exposure, improve market access, and support the growth of a decentralized, Bitcoin-native financial ecosystem.

Already, UTXO Management has provided examples by seeding and supporting several high-profile Bitcoin treasury companies:

Metaplanet (TSE: 3350) – Japan’s fastest-growing public Bitcoin company with 13,350 BTC, and #1 performing public company of 2024 out of 55,000 globally.
The Smarter Web Company (AQUIS: SWC) – A UK-based web services firm that IPO’d with a BTC treasury strategy and has returned more than 100x since listing.
The Blockchain Group (Euronext: ALTBG) – Europe’s first Bitcoin treasury company, with over 1000% BTC yield YTD 2025.
Backed by over $750+ million in capital, Nakamoto can scale this strategy globally—market by market, exchange by exchange, one Bitcoin treasury company at a time.

As Bitcoin increasingly functions as the emergent global hurdle rate for capital—strategies that generate returns in excess of Bitcoin itself become especially valuable. Nakamoto’s model is designed not just to preserve value in BTC terms, but to compound it. In that context, firms capable of consistently outperforming Bitcoin through disciplined BTC-denominated strategies are likely to earn outsized attention—and may increasingly attract capital as investors seek returns above the Bitcoin benchmark.

The Nakamoto Strategy Explained
The strategy rests on a straightforward insight: market access constraints are as important as Bitcoin itself. In many jurisdictions, institutional capital cannot buy or custody Bitcoin directly. But that same capital can buy public equities that hold Bitcoin as a treasury reserve.

This creates a specific opportunity:

Seed new Bitcoin treasury companies: These are established in jurisdictions where access to BTC is structurally constrained, or where no such companies yet exist.
Deploy Bitcoin strategically: BTC may be contributed directly or indirectly through equity financing mechanisms like PIPEs, warrants, or structured investments.
Enable public market revaluation: These companies may begin to trade at a premium to the value of their BTC holdings (an mNAV expansion).
Recycle capital through appreciation: Nakamoto can participate in this cycle and may reinvest in additional companies or accumulate further BTC.
The Nakamoto Flywheel below illustrates how equity premiums from public markets are strategically converted into long-term Bitcoin reserves. This repeatable model compounds Bitcoin-denominated value with each cycle—building balance sheet strength at global scale.

Key Mechanics: How the Strategy Multiplies Value
mNAV Arbitrage and Strategic Premium Capture
The Nakamoto strategy generates value by leveraging the structural dynamics of public markets and the constrained nature of Bitcoin access in many jurisdictions. One of the foundational mechanisms of the Nakamoto strategy is mNAV (multiple of Net Asset Value) arbitrage. When Nakamoto allocates capital to a Bitcoin treasury company in a jurisdiction where no other compliant BTC exposure vehicles exist, that company often begins trading at a multiple of its net Bitcoin holdings. This outcome assigns a strategic premium to Nakamoto’s deployed capital and effectively increases the market value of Bitcoin originally acquired at or near spot.

BTC Yield as the Core Performance Metric
Rather than focusing on traditional accounting metrics, Nakamoto evaluates performance in Bitcoin-denominated terms—specifically by tracking Bitcoin per diluted share. This measure, referred to as BTC Yield, captures the compounding benefit when a treasury company increases its Bitcoin holdings at a rate faster than its equity issuance. This reinforces long-term alignment with Bitcoin-native value creation.

Nakamoto also tracks look-through BTC ownership—its proportional claim on Bitcoin held across portfolio companies—as a secondary KPI, ensuring every equity move is benchmarked in Bitcoin terms.

While most Bitcoin treasury companies rely heavily on repeated equity issuance—diluting existing shareholders in order to grow BTC-per-share, Nakamoto can compound holdings without dilution by running what is referred to as the mNAV² strategy. In practice, this means:

Seed at Intrinsic Value: Nakamoto launches or invests in a Bitcoin treasury company at or near 1× mNAV—meaning the equity is priced roughly in line with the company’s net Bitcoin holdings.
Unlock the Premium: Public markets re-rate the company, assigning a valuation multiple above its Bitcoin holdings due to scarcity, strategic positioning, or narrative momentum—creating an mNAV premium.
Recycle Without Dilution: Nakamoto harvests a portion of the appreciated equity, redeploying the proceeds into additional BTC or new ventures—without issuing new Nakamoto shares, enabling BTC-per-share growth through capital efficiency.
As competition among listed treasury vehicles intensifies, markets are likely to reward the firms that can expand BTC-per-share through non-dilutive mechanisms. mNAV² makes that outcome native to Nakamoto’s playbook, turning balance-sheet efficiency itself into a competitive moat.

Closing the Institutional Access Gap
Jurisdictional limitations prevent many institutional investors from directly holding Bitcoin. However, they are often permitted to invest in public equities that hold BTC as a treasury asset. Nakamoto addresses this asymmetry by seeding and supporting regionally compliant public vehicles that serve as legal and practical conduits for institutional Bitcoin exposure.

Advantages of Operating Through Public Markets
By using public markets as its operational arena, Nakamoto benefits from transparency, ongoing liquidity, and efficient price discovery. These attributes allow it to recycle capital efficiently and expand into new geographies quickly. Unlike traditional private market structures, this approach supports scale, visibility, and regulatory alignment in real-time.

The 40% Rule: Redeploying Gains Into Bitcoin
A key structural requirement of the Nakamoto strategy is compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940, which mandates that no more than 40% of Nakamoto’s balance sheet can consist of securities such as public equities. Bitcoin, classified as a commodity, does not count toward this limit.

This regulatory boundary shapes how Nakamoto must operate:

As equity positions in Bitcoin treasury companies appreciate, Nakamoto is compelled to sell down those stakes to stay within the 40% threshold.
This naturally reinforces the strategy’s focus on cycling gains from equity back into Bitcoin—accelerating BTC accumulation.
To manage this constraint, Nakamoto has begun using innovative structures such as Bitcoin-denominated convertible notes. These instruments help fix asset exposure, enabling gradual conversion and avoiding sudden threshold breaches.
The cap is not a limitation on ambition—it’s a forcing function for capital discipline and strategic BTC reinvestment. As Nakamoto’s balance sheet grows, so does its capacity to hold larger equity positions—always with Bitcoin as the core reserve asset.

Strategic Instruments: Bitcoin-Denominated Convertible Notes
To manage compliance with the 40% securities threshold and mitigate volatility exposure, Nakamoto is likely to rely on Bitcoin-denominated convertible note structures in future deployments. These instruments offer a flexible way to structure exposure—allowing Nakamoto to fix the value of an investment on its balance sheet while retaining the option to convert into equity over time.

This structure presents several strategic advantages:

Regulatory Buffer: Because conversion is optional and can be staged, these notes help delay classification as securities—preserving balance sheet headroom under the 40 Act.
Gradual Entry and Exit: Nakamoto can incrementally convert notes as needed, smoothing market impact and aligning exposure with evolving balance sheet capacity.
This approach has already shown promise in models pursued by The Blockchain Group and H100, where similar structures have enabled Bitcoin-native capital deployment without triggering regulatory friction. If scaled appropriately, Bitcoin-denominated convertibles could become a defining instrument in Nakamoto’s toolkit—one that aligns capital strategy with both performance and compliance.

Addressing Criticism of the Nakamoto Strategy
Navigating Tax Complexity
A recurring concern centers around the tax consequences of transferring Bitcoin between entities. In many jurisdictions, such transfers can trigger taxable events, reducing capital efficiency. Nakamoto mitigates this risk by avoiding direct BTC transfers and instead utilizing equity-based structures—such as PIPEs, warrants, and joint ventures—that provide exposure without incurring immediate tax obligations.

Interpreting mNAV Premiums and Narrative Risk
Critics often question the durability of mNAV premiums, suggesting they may be driven more by market hype than fundamentals. Nakamoto responds to this concern by focusing on Bitcoin-per-share growth rather than valuation multiples alone. The firm emphasizes BTC Yield as a more reliable metric and prioritizes tangible BTC accumulation through recapitalizations and disciplined capital deployment.

Governance and Operational Influence
Some observers have expressed concern about Nakamoto’s degree of influence over the companies it supports. Nakamoto does not aim to control daily operations but ensures strategic alignment through governance rights, board representation, and equity stakes. This structure allows Nakamoto to influence treasury policy and maintain Bitcoin-centric discipline without compromising the autonomy of each company.

Managing Market Volatility and Compression Risk
The potential for mNAV compression—particularly in risk-off environments—is a known challenge. Nakamoto mitigates this risk by focusing on jurisdictions with low initial valuations and unmet demand for Bitcoin exposure. Even if valuation multiples contract, the companies Nakamoto supports continue to hold BTC on their balance sheets, preserving intrinsic value regardless of market sentiment.

Capturing Value in a Bitcoin-Denominated Model
A related concern involves how Nakamoto captures tangible value from the companies it helps establish or support. Unlike models that rely on dividend payments or near-term liquidity events, Nakamoto benefits through long-term strategic equity stakes, pre-IPO warrant structures, and equity appreciation tied directly to BTC-per-share growth. This approach enables value capture that aligns with its thesis of Bitcoin-denominated performance, without compromising the capital structure or autonomy of the underlying companies.

Differentiation from Traditional Private Equity Models
Comparisons are often drawn between Nakamoto’s strategy and private equity investing. While there are structural similarities, Nakamoto distinguishes itself through its liquidity profile, public market transparency, and alignment with Bitcoin-native accounting. Rather than operating as a fund, Nakamoto functions as a public infrastructure builder—identifying underserved markets, constructing regulatory frameworks, and absorbing early-stage risk in order to unlock institutional Bitcoin access at scale.

The Role of Nakamoto vs. Direct Investment
Some critics question whether Nakamoto is simply a middle layer between investors and the companies themselves—arguing that sophisticated capital could bypass Nakamoto and invest directly. In practice, however, Nakamoto delivers differentiated value by sourcing deals in overlooked markets, architecting compliant listing structures, and catalyzing early demand. It acts as a bridge between Bitcoin-native capital and traditional financial systems, taking on the narrative and structural lift that many institutions are unwilling or unable to initiate alone.

The irreplaceable edge for Nakamoto is deal flow. Nakamoto can source, structure, and price transactions at the moment of inception—access that simply isn’t available to most outside capital until valuations have already moved.

Conclusion: Nakamoto and the Formation of Bitcoin-Native Capital Markets
The Nakamoto strategy represents an emerging capital architecture centered around Bitcoin. By enabling market access, accelerating public-market velocity, and aligning incentives around BTC-per-share accumulation, Nakamoto is helping build a new generation of treasury-first public companies.

With over $750 million raised, operating examples across Tokyo, London, and Paris, and a growing network of prospective listings, Nakamoto is executing on a strategy designed to bridge the gap between capital markets and Bitcoin adoption.

As traditional financial institutions continue to face structural and regulatory barriers to holding BTC directly, the model Nakamoto is developing may offer a scalable, compliant path forward. It’s not just a capital strategy. It’s a structural response to Bitcoin’s growing role in global finance."
2025-07-02,Bitcoin Mining Has Huge Role In Energy Production Expansion - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQNndQTndLT1pyZ1UzUkZwampVbW5iNFE1czlQbkUwVFZKZE1Qb0JZN2xvNW0wMGZaWTA4NUZhdXptUjg2cXUyektOSVBjdFl2czBDUVRTd1lBQ2lGbmp0aklUX0NTbG1vdWM0dWxKVFB0bTJSVXhhOUY0Z2VaN2o2NENsaUZLWWR5SFEzQUZuTDJBRFZFNDY1QkVrOS0xb1lRdVZwQg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The explosive growth of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and digital finance has transformed electric industry operations.  Forward-thinking miners and utilities can leverage these technological shifts to build generation capacity and create more resilient electrical grids.

DATA CENTER LANDSCAPE
Data centers locate where speed of energization, connectivity, and operational costs align favorably, but speed of energization remains a significant challenge.  North American data center leasing vacancy rates are below 2% in 2024, down from over 10% in 2018. End-users now pre-lease capacity years in advance as new generation is slow to energize.

Unlike traditional load growth that materializes gradually over years, data centers demand immediate energy solutions.  This creates a difficult position for some electric utilities with typical new generation planning—build when demand is reliably certain to arrive.

New electricity generation projects can require 2-7 years development time, while major data center deployment has compressed requirements of 18-24 months.  Some utilities fund new generation ahead of need, but that typically leads to subsidizing projects until new load arrives, increasing costs for existing customers.

UNTAPPED OPPORTUNITIES
Many are already aware of bitcoin mining’s value proposition of demand management, excess energy conversion (flared gas, etc.) and remote energy resource access.

Demand Management: Mining operations can be curtailed during peak demand periods more easily than traditional loads, serving as valuable demand response resources necessary for grid balancing, particularly useful when variable generation resources are connected to the grid.

Wasted Energy Conversion:  Companies take energy that would have otherwise been wasted—such as flared gas at oil production facilities—and convert it to electricity for bitcoin mining operations.

Stranded Asset Utilization: Similar to wasted energy conversion, mining operations can monetize remote generation resources that would otherwise be underutilized due to transmission constraints, internet connectivity, or economic conditions.

What I am writing about is an overlooked opportunity:  Bitcoin mining’s unique load profile provides value through the ability to build new resources ahead of need, avoiding subsidization by existing customers, and allowing distributed transmission construction compatible with data center growth.

BUILD-AHEAD TO OVERCOME TIMING MISMATCHES
Strategic deployment of bitcoin mining as partners in new generation construction transforms build-ahead economics—mining operations create load from facility energization.  When public utilities build new generation and partner with mining operations, they can create new revenue upon energization.  This has multiple benefits:

Project load certainty for funding
Increased energy availability for new load
Subsidization avoidance
Reduced grid congestion
Utilities that plan for new generation today can factor in partnerships with bitcoin mining companies, even if other loads are not on the horizon, and can scale mining operations to fit new generation size.  Miners take bitcoin price and mining difficulty risk in exchange for long-term beneficial electricity rates.  This provides the utility with sufficient load certainty to fund construction projects that would have otherwise not been available, and gives miners access to long-term funding for business expansion.  

More new generation when energy production growth is a national competitive interest benefits everyone.

Additionally, by building generation for just-in-time miner loads, subsidization of new generation by existing utility customers becomes a thing of the past.  As power purchase agreements end and new load arrives to the region, energy transitions to other long-term off-takers.

Additionally, as new load arrives, transmission infrastructure is built to suit, again, not requiring subsidization of arriving loads by existing ratepayers.  Infrastructure can be built as needed, where needed, resulting in more geographically dispersed load points and reducing grid congestion.

THE PARTNERSHIP ADVANTAGE
A partnership between electric utilities and bitcoin mining companies opens value within utility service territories with abundant small to medium untapped generation resources by energizing resources now, at a time when tapping new resources is dearly needed.

New generation projects that partner with mining companies provide revenue at energization, tapping unused resources, leading to lower system-wide rates and ensuring local ratepayers benefit directly from local resources, creating jobs and new business opportunities.

Electricity’s value far exceeds its cost per kilowatt-hour, and partnerships forged between bitcoin mining companies and electric utilities provide an amazing chance to build power plant capacity that will fuel local business, strengthen communities and power entire nations."

“The bank plans to issue a five-year, dollar-denominated investment certificate linked to the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF which will offer a 100% capital protection at maturity,” according to an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News that was also confirmed by the bank.

The maximum return of the investment is up to 85% of the ETF’s performance, with a minimum investment requirement of $25,000, according to the memo. The UniCredit certificate will be only available to the bank’s professional clients in Italy from July 1 to July 28.

The move reflects growing institutional demand for regulated Bitcoin investments. BlackRock’s IBIT has seen a rapid growth since launching in the U.S. in January 2024, which now manages $75 billion.

“We are seeing increasing interest from professional investors in instruments tied to emerging asset classes such as cryptocurrencies,” said the Head of Group Investment Product Solutions and Equity & Credit Sales and Trading of UniCredit Chicco di Stasi. “With this product, we offer our professional clients a distinctive solution —the first of its kind in Italy.”

On March 25, 2025, BlackRock expanded its footprint in the space with the launch of a Bitcoin exchange traded product in Europe. The iShares Bitcoin ETP began trading on Xetra and Euronext Paris under the ticker IB1T, and on Euronext Amsterdam under BTCN. The product launched with a temporary fee waiver of 10 basis points, lowering its expense ratio to 0.15% until the end of the year.

Bitcoin recently hit a new all-time high of $124,000 and is up nearly 30% for the year.

Institutional adoption of Bitcoin remains strong, with money still flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs.

While many factors are trending in Bitcoin's favor right now, the overall macroeconomic outlook could put a brake on its upward ascent.

10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin ›

On Aug. 14, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) surged to a new all-time high above $124,000. The world's most popular cryptocurrency is now up nearly 30% for the year and appears poised for further gains, based on improving market sentiment for crypto.

But can Bitcoin soar even higher, to $150,000? To answer that question, it's important to consider what's powering it.

Catalysts for Bitcoin
There are several different catalysts pushing Bitcoin higher right now. One of them, of course, is the recent executive order from the White House that will open the door for crypto to be included in 401(k) plans. This is expected to unlock trillions of dollars in new capital, a big chunk of which will likely flow into Bitcoin.

Another key factor is institutional adoption. Simply put, everyone seems to be buying Bitcoin these days. Corporations are buying Bitcoin. Bitcoin treasury companies are buying Bitcoin. And the U.S. government continues to suggest that it will find a ""budget-neutral"" way to buy Bitcoin.

At the same time, money continues to flow into spot Bitcoin ETFs. This is arguably the best way to track institutional demand. If inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs are positive, it means Bitcoin is likely to glide still higher. If inflows dry up, Bitcoin could be in for a rocky ride.

Finally, there's the overall macroeconomic situation.​​ The broader market seems to be coming to grips with tariffs and what they likely will mean for the U.S. economy. For now, inflationary pressures do not seem as threatening as they were back in April, and investors are now expecting a series of interest rate cuts starting in September. Historically, lower rates have been favorable for crypto and have led to more money moving into risky, volatile assets such as Bitcoin.

So everything is trending in Bitcoin's favor. A combination of institutional adoption, improving market sentiment, and expectations of rate cuts are juicing the market and helping to push Bitcoin higher.

What do prediction markets think?
That said, Bitcoin is hardly a lock to hit $150,000 this year. One way to get a sense of what the overall market thinks is by looking at data from prediction markets. There, people are trading contracts based on where they think the price of Bitcoin is going next.

On the Kalshi prediction market, for example, traders think Bitcoin has a 75% chance of hitting $130,000 this year, a 53% chance of hitting $140,000, and a 37% chance of hitting $150,000. So, basically, there's a 1-in-3 chance that Bitcoin will hit $150,000 by the end of the year.

Things get a bit dicier from there. For example, there is only a 27% chance that Bitcoin will hit $160,000 and a 10% chance that Bitcoin will hit $200,000. This last data point is particularly noteworthy because, at the start of the year, just about everyone was predicting that Bitcoin would double in value and easily hit $200,000.

What to look for next
The market is pricing in an interest rate cut, but that can't happen if inflation rears its ugly head. And that's exactly what happened almost as soon as Bitcoin hit $124,000. New economic data suggested that inflationary pressures were building. As a result, Bitcoin quickly slid back down to $120,000.

With that in mind, Bitcoin investors should keep a close eye on any and all economic data that the Federal Reserve might take into account when deciding how to adjust interest rates in September. Notably, this marks a departure from the way people invested in Bitcoin in the past. Historically, money has flowed into Bitcoin regardless of what people think the Fed might (or might not) be doing.

Just a few years ago, Bitcoin was completely uncorrelated with any major asset class. And that meant Bitcoin could zig when other assets zagged. But we're starting to see a correlation with stocks, and especially tech stocks. With institutional investors lining up for a piece of Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency is starting to behave more and more like a risky, high-upside tech stock.

Long-term, I'm still bullish on Bitcoin. But as we saw back in April, when Bitcoin buckled under the threat of tariffs, it remains a highly volatile digital asset subject to the broader macroeconomic outlook. There's a reasonably good chance Bitcoin will hit $150,000, but only if the broader economy doesn't deteriorate.

2025-06-27,If Institutions Are Buying Why Isn’t The Bitcoin Price Going Up? - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTFB4eHo0RTdOa0ZBNzhnczZDa0NwbHpXTTliZXpiV0NRRnFKa3pYVVdYRld2dTBsRkp5bFh2b2lZWXZEX1FoY3RnLUJnX2xwNHllbjVHbEJld18tZ1VkOU9Wa1BXTFg0a0lIVk4wUFMxM2VNNTZMemh1WHpvWQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ETF inflows and institutional purchases continue to climb, yet many investors are puzzled by the muted Bitcoin price action. With billions flowing into BTC, why aren’t we seeing the price explode to new highs? The reality is more nuanced than it first appears.

Bitcoin ETF Inflows
Looking at the ETF cumulative inflows chart (excluding GBTC outflows), it’s clear that demand from institutional players has been robust. Since the most recent pullback in late March, net ETF inflows have climbed from roughly 527,000 BTC to over 630,000 BTC, an increase of around 100,000 BTC in under 3 months. These are significant numbers, yet the Bitcoin price has largely mainly drifted sideways since the start of 2025.

It’s important to remember that not all ETF flows represent “institutional” buying in the purest sense. Many ETF purchases come from client allocations, for example, family offices or high-net-worth individuals using platforms like BlackRock. Still, these flows matter, and the steady accumulation is a positive driver for long-term supply and demand dynamics.

Bitcoin Treasury Buying
Complementing ETF inflows, corporate treasury buying has also been strong, with (Micro)Strategy leading the charge. MSTR alone have seen their holdings have jumped from roughly 528,000 BTC to over 592,000 BTC in this year alone. Across all treasury companies tracked, total holdings now exceed 823,000 BTC, representing an astounding $86 billion in value.

Despite this, many market participants feel underwhelmed by price action compared to prior cycles. But we must contextualize expectations: the BTC market cap is now in the multi-trillion-dollar range. The sheer scale of capital required to drive exponential moves today dwarfs previous cycles. Comparing this cycle to the 10x returns of earlier eras isn’t realistic. In truth, BTC has more than doubled from $40K at the time of ETF launch to recent levels above $110K, a still monumental achievement for a maturing asset class.

Bitcoin Supply Overhang
To understand why Bitcoin prices haven’t surged even further, we must examine selling behavior. By analyzing HODL Waves data for 1-5 year bands, we can quantify long-term holder profit-taking. Over the past three months, more than 240,000 BTC from these older bands has been distributed to the market, nearly a quarter-million BTC in net outflows.

This selling has largely counterbalanced institutional accumulation. Given that daily miner issuance still adds another ~450 BTC to the market, we see why price has struggled to break higher: the market is in a state of supply-demand equilibrium.

Meanwhile, open interest on BTC derivatives markets has exploded. From under $5B less than 3 years ago to over $25B today. Many new participants prefer are opting to trade “paper BTC” on derivatives rather than buying spot BTC, which reduces the positive influence on price of increased market participants.

Bitcoin Bullish Shifts
There is however now reason for optimism. Long-term holder selling is now decelerating, with recent net outflows falling below 1,000 BTC per day, a substantial reduction from previous monthly averages just weeks ago. If institutional inflows remain steady and retail demand starts to awaken, even at levels seen earlier this cycle rather than extreme prior peaks, we could easily see another powerful leg higher. Past instances show that when retail flows surge from these levels, BTC can double in price within months.

Conclusion
ETF inflows and treasury purchases are pouring billions of dollars into Bitcoin, but the muted Bitcoin price reaction makes perfect sense when viewed through the lens of supply and demand. Heavy profit-taking by long-term holders and growing derivatives speculation have balanced out the inflows.

As long-term selling subsides and institutional buying continues, the stage is being set for the next bullish impulse. Whether we see the euphoric retail mania of prior cycles remains to be seen, but even modest retail inflows combined with current institutional demand could drive prices sharply higher sooner rather than later."
2025-06-26,Tahini’s Bitcoin Treasury: How A Family Chain Outsmarted Inflation - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQTnBia216dlU0X1h1a0cwbEpxV0k2X2ZQQ3NtZGtaSDRoWUJ5T3Y2dkoxM1RQU1AwSnAwN1FRMk8wUXZVTnFiM0tHMmEtOTZGa3ZJRkJuX2RjRU9UQlRqeEJacUtuRlVYT3l1OGxWTnZqODJWWmZFamZnVVhocm9hUjI1eTlKN2lVTUFzS0ExTE9JdGhoWVpISHFrZ2FnSEFvSnl3?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tahini’s Restaurants, a Canadian fast-casual restaurant chain specializing in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine, integrated bitcoin into its business in 2020 and has been refining its strategy ever since. Today Bitcoin makes up over 70% of their reserves and has made a critical difference in their expansion to 62 restaurants in just over a decade.

“We just kept putting more and more money into bitcoin.” Omar Hamam, CEO and co-founder of Tahini’s, told Bitcoin Magazine. Omar and his brother Aly Hamam founded the company in 2012, starting with one restaurant in London, Ontario. Tahini’s has since grown to 62 restaurants across the country, their expansion amplified by their adoption of an early bitcoin treasury strategy, partially inspired by Michael Saylor in 2020. The bold move gave them a pool of capital with which they could compete with the giants of the fast-casual food industry.

“We’re competing with McDonald’s, and Chipotle,” said Omar, adding, “All these companies have more money than 100 Tahini’s. So, to have an advantage like that, where we have a treasury and a balance sheet strategy that puts us in a comfortable place financially, that lets us preserve our wealth over time and space … it was the best decision we’ve ever made for our business.”

The company has implemented multiple innovative strategies throughout its journey, including the deployment of Bitcoin ATMs to many of their franchises, a new media strategy that, according to Aly, has netted them “three billion views over the last five years across all social media platforms,” including a YouTube channel with over 3.2 million subscribers and, of course, their bitcoin treasury strategy.

Aly’s Fascination with Bitcoin Post-COVID, Influenced by Egyptian Currency Devaluation
Aly Hamam was the main driver behind the restaurant’s bitcoin strategy. Shaped by his family’s experiences with the Egyptian pound’s aggressive devaluations over the past 20 years, the catastrophic consequences of runaway inflation were deeply personal to him, an experience that set him up well to discover bitcoin during the March 2020 market crash. “So, I came from Egypt, and over the last two decades, I’ve seen the Egyptian pound drop probably 85% or something like that. And I’ve seen our family struggle. I’ve seen my parents struggle. My parents had money sitting in Egypt over that time. I’ve seen their life savings get wiped away. Sometimes with Egypt, it happens like flash crashes. So, the government will come in and can just devalue the currency within a month, 50%,” Aly recalled.

When the COVID-19 market panic happened in March of 2020, the price of bitcoin went from a high of $10,000 to as low as $4,000 in weeks. “I bought a little bit as a gimmick and because it was just down so much, I was like, yeah, I might as well buy it. … The more I studied, I fell down the rabbit hole hard. Over the next few months, I just kept buying more and more and more, and you know those first three months when you discover bitcoin, it’s just like a never-ending consuming over every aspect of your life, listening to podcasts, reading books, and just buying more and more and more,” Aly explained.

After the crash, Bitcoin bounced back up to around $10,000, where it consolidated for months as governments throughout the world prepared their COVID-19 response and unleashed trillions of newly printed dollars into the global economy. Interest rates in the U.S. dropped to zero, and COVID-19 support checks started to flow to anyone in Canada who filled out a form. Omar recalled that “the government was just literally printing money nonstop. And it wasn’t just the Canadian government. It was every single government out there that was doing it. So, we knew there was going to be an inflation problem.” The Bitcoin halving was also taking place right around that time, an additional fundamental force that arguably led to one of the most impressive bull runs in its history.

This was the same era when Michael Saylor famously entered the industry and became the most famous Bitcoin bull to date. However, Saylor’s many speeches and documents on how to structure a corporate bitcoin strategy and how to convince the board of directors or other business partners were just starting to hit the podcast circuit, and the bitcoin treasury playbook was still in its infancy.

Once Aly was “100% in,” he started orange-pilling his family. “So, I started orange-pilling my business partners, my brother, my cousin, and they started buying it personally.” Personally they all started buying Bitcoin in small amounts, but using the company’s reserves was a far more difficult process, Aly explained that “it wasn’t quick. It was a back-and-forth where I wanted us to put the company money into bitcoin, and they were kind of on the edge. ‘That’s a crazy idea.’ ‘This’ and ‘that,’ and then we just kept going back and forth, back and forth until Michael Saylor announced that first buy. I had already set up like all the accounts and all of that was just ready to go. So, when Michael Saylor bought that first batch of bitcoin, that was what pushed us all over the cliff. And a week later, we put whatever money the company had into bitcoin.”

Acquisition Price, DCA Strategy, and Persistence Through Bear Markets
Tahini’s bitcoin investment strategy differs from today’s public companies, which issue stock (and other financial instruments) to buy bitcoin and add to their reserves. As a private company that started accumulating bitcoin before the ETF in the U.S. was approved, Tahini’s took a simpler approach: buy as much as reasonably possible each month, forever. According to Omar, today bitcoin represents over 70% of the company’s reserves.

While their timing was excellent, having started to buy bitcoin for their treasury at around $10,000, the strategy known as “dollar-cost averaging” works very well regardless of price, even in a bear market. Have a look at this DCA calculation, for example.

If you started putting $1,000 into bitcoin every two weeks at the top of the 2021 bull market — at nearly $70,000 per coin — every time you made a purchase at a lower price after that, you would be lowering your average purchase price. The result is that on the way out of the bear market — in this example, above roughly $30,000 — you would be at break-even and would be perfectly positioned for the upcoming bull market. The only requirement is having a long-term investment mindset.

“You buy every month, every single month. Ups and downs. I know it sounds too simple, but actually, this is the only way to do it. Right. You just buy, don’t try to outsmart the system, in my opinion, unless you’re really good at this. Put a number aside every single month, and it just pans out. And if you think about it, if you look at the last four years, you would have made more than 2-30x your investment,” Omar explained. He added that, “I have this conversation with a lot of people. Friends, family, everybody. And I always tell them, listen, just start somewhere. Don’t put a big amount and see how it works out for you. Right. So, let’s say you put a thousand dollars and watch it as a number that’s not going to be too bad if anything happens to it. See, if let’s say next year, this 1,000 becomes 1,200 or 1,500. Now imagine if you had 100,000 or imagine if you had a million, right? What would have happened to that amount?”

While there are no hard rules about the optimal frequency of the DCA strategy in Bitcoin, be it for individuals or corporations, Tahini’s opted for monthly purchases, as it made sense given their accounting processes. “Every month, we have a P&L. Every month, we see our profit and losses. And we decide at the end of the month, okay, we’re gonna put this much aside,” Omar explained.

When it comes to amounts, Omar explained that they do not invest a fixed or percentage-based amount. “It’s also about, are we investing this month back in the business? Are we not? What are our expenses like? Do we have any big payments? So, you know, sometimes you have all these expenses at the end of the year. So, you have your month highs and lows and so on, but the key is to stay consistent in putting money in. How much is what you have to decide every month.”

To Sell or to Mortgage Your Bitcoin?
When it comes to monetizing their Bitcoin Tahini’s has opted for the simple strategy. When the time is right, and the business opportunity demands it, they sell some Bitcoin and buy it back later, as per their standard DCA strategy, and integrate the capital gains tax into their accounting flow. Omar explained that, “When it comes time to reinvest, you know, you always need money. So, let’s say you want to do a huge marketing campaign as a franchise, right? You need to dip into those savings. And when you have money, you have power. The more money you have, the more you can be free to make the right decision for the company instead of just doing what you can afford.”

Challenges with Accepting Bitcoin Payments and POS Integration
As one of the first steps in their Bitcoin integration, Tahini’s explored the possibility of accepting bitcoin as payment at their restaurants; however, a series of challenges arose that forced them to pivot. Many of these challenges remain for businesses throughout the world and involve the entrenched, closed-source and walled-garden models of popular payment processing systems.

“A lot of these point-of-sale system companies, they do their own payment processing, and they just don’t have the capability to accept Bitcoin in their system,” Omar explained about the world of merchant-grade POS. Many of these systems are closed-source with very restrictive APIs that the Bitcoin economy cannot easily integrate into, a moat that has been an issue for bitcoin payment adoption since its inception.

However, the friction to merchant adoption is deeper than just a POS moat; the feature list merchants need to stay competitive is very complex, and most Bitcoin payment systems today are still lagging behind:

“The POS system is not just about the payment. It’s also about how they build menus in the background. The POS system gives you reports. It gives you an analysis of what you sold, when you sold it, what these stores are doing, what time of the day they’re busy, what time of the day they’re not busy, how to ask for whatever you’re ordering. It’s very complicated, right? So, the payment is just the last piece of the puzzle. So, when we choose a POS system, it’s not just about the payment system. It’s also about their functionality and how good they are as a system.”

To top it off, POS systems that integrate bitcoin would also have to support fiat currencies for them to be viable to normal merchants today, raising the barrier to entry and competition much further.

As a result, Tahini’s did the next best thing: They added Bitcoin ATMs to 10 of their restaurants in partnership with Bitcoin Well, a Canadian Bitcoin ATM company, opting to take in all profits from the machines in Bitcoin and allocating it to isolated accounts for each restaurant. Though Aly reports that these ATMs were only bringing in about $250 CAD a month, since 2021, these “sats flows” — as some people in the industry are calling them — add up, and with the price of bitcoin rising, each of those restaurants now has over $40,000 of bitcoin per corresponding restaurant, a very significant balance.

Nevertheless, Omar is optimistic that these barriers will fall, as interest in bitcoin payments is stronger than ever. “I think bitcoin is really growing at a rapid pace, and it’s being adopted now by a lot of companies, and people are learning more and more about Bitcoin, and they’re becoming much more aware about Bitcoin. So, I think it’s just a matter of time.”"
2025-06-25,Bitcoin Layer 2: Lightning Network - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE5GUElIWmZmaGRZQ3NvdTZsVFo4bV9RMENnQWdYQ29hN2hwQXNid2o3V1pFNWVxRk14RXZPQ3MzUUNzcTh6X2l2LWV1SW5BQk5pOEtJcGRrRXJ5UnJQNVBVUzA0el9hX3I3SHlRaFlkMjhIWXZmenB1SDlQWQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Lightning Network is a routed network of payment channels originally proposed by Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon in 2015, with major implementations having been built by Blockstream (CLN), Lightning Labs (LND), ACINQ (Eclair), and Spiral (LDK). 

Payment channels are an old concept in Bitcoin, where a user deposited funds into a 2-of-2 multisig address, and a payer can pre-sign transactions allocating more and more funds to a receiver. Original payment channels were one way, and had expiry times before which the receiver must close the channel before a pre-signed refund transaction would allow the payer to reclaim 100% of the funds they had allocated to the payment channel. 

The two major innovations of the Lightning Network are a type of payment channel that isn’t limited to being unidirectional and having a hard expiration date, and the concept of using Hash-timelock Contracts (HTLCs) in order to atomically route payments across multiple payment channels. 

The major drawback of Lightning, and payment channels in general, is the liquidity dynamics inherent to them. In order to receive money, users must already have a payment channel open to them with enough funds allocated to facilitate that payment. In order for payments to be routed across the network, every channel must have the appropriate amount of funds on the appropriate side of the channel in order to forward that payment. 

Despite these drawbacks, Lightning has seen major success in use and growth since 2018 when it first went live on the Bitcoin network. 

Poon-Dryja Channels
The key problem in going from a time-limited, unidirectional payment channel to one that is not time limited and bidirectional boils down to one problem: once you create a transaction and sign it there is no way to unmake it, or take it back. That transaction exists, and until the coin(s) it spends are spent by some other transaction, it remains valid and can be used at any time. 

The solution to this problem lies at the heart of the Poon-Dryja channel. You might not be able to undo a pre-signed transaction, but you can create a very strong incentive to never use older ones, and even a benefit for the party that someone is attempting to cheat if they try. What facilitates this is the concept of a revocation key.

n a Poon-Dryja channel, each counterparty in a channel has their own mirrored set of pre-signed transactions, called commitment transactions. Each channel update or change of balances is simply each channel peer signing a new set of these commitment transactions. Each party’s commitment transaction gives the other party’s funds back immediately, but they must wait for a timelock to expire before they can claim their funds back. This is to allow the introduction of the revocation key. 

Whenever a channel state update occurs, before it is considered finalized, both parties must exchange revocation keys for their most recent past commitment transactions. If either party were to ever try submitting an old transaction to the blockchain, claiming funds that are currently owned by the other party in the current state, then the victim can use the penalty key to confiscate 100% of the funds the cheating party has in that old channel state. 

Hash-timelock Contracts (HTLCs)
Routing payments across multiple payment channels in a network, in a safe and secure way, is possible thanks to HTLCs. This is the same mechanism used to facilitate atomic swapping of different assets on a single or across multiple blockchains.

An HTLC establishes an output that can be spent in one of two ways, either by the receiving party if they can provide the preimage to a hash that creates a hashlock, or by the sending party after a timelock has expired. This allows someone trying to pay another person across the network to pass along HTLC proposals from themselves all the way to the receiver, locked to the same hashlock generated by the receiver. When the receiver’s channel party passes the HTLC to them, they can release the preimage.

Each party then, going backwards towards the sender, reveals the preimage. At each hop the channel is updated, moving the funds in the HTLC to the appropriate side of the channel. From the receiver backwards to the sender the timelock for the refund path gets longer each hop. This is to ensure if something goes wrong and someone must close their channel and settle the HTLC on-chain that the preceding parties can detect the preimage there and update their channels appropriately. 

Gossip Protocol
To successfully route payments across the network, Lightning nodes need to have some general idea of what the network looks like. This is what the gossip protocol accomplishes. It broadcasts information about different Lightning nodes and the channels they have open so wallets can have an idea of what the network looks like in order to pick routes to try to pass payments through. 

This is a very simple protocol that consists of three messages, a channel announcement, a node announcement, and a channel update. Each of these messages has a specific dependency with the others, and each plays a role in propagating information about the payment channel network that users can use in order to find viable routes for their payments. 

The channel announcement message propagates the information needed to prove a Lightning channel actually exists. The UTXO that is funding it, signatures from both keys involved in the multisignature address holding it. Signatures from the Lightning node identity keys, which every Lightning node has, on the UTXO proofs and signatures. Everything to prove this is a real Lightning channel, backed by real bitcoin on the blockchain, and not a fake message spamming the network. 

Only after making a channel announcement broadcast to the network can a node propagate a node announcement message. This announcement includes the nodes identity key, a network address they can be reached at, any nickname they choose to assign, and a few other pieces of metadata. 

The channel update message facilitates information about fees and conditions for routing payments a specific channel is subject to. This includes the minimum and maximum value being transmitted a node will accept for an HTLC, the base and percentage fee rate charged (Lightning payments must pay a base absolute fee and then a second fee calculated as a percentage of the payment value), and the time difference between them and the previous hop in a payment they require for HTLCs. 

This allows every Lightning node to construct a view of the overall network they can use to inform payment routes they attempt in order to route their own payments across the network. 

Onion Routing
Every message passed between nodes across the Lightning Network related to routing a payment is onion routed. Every message is wrapped in a layer of encryption so that every participant in a payment route can only decrypt and read the message for it. This message is the instructions on which channel peer to forward the payment and payment information to next. 

That’s it. 

This provides some degree of privacy for payments across the network, as each individual party involved in routing is only capable of seeing their single hop in the overall path. They can see which partner forwarded it to them, and which partner they forwarded it to. They don’t see the ultimate destination or source. 

This is why the gossip protocol exists, and why the sender of a payment is the one who constructs the payment routes they attempt to try. By having the sender construct the route, the payment is guaranteed a degree of privacy, but for the sender to construct the route they must know what the network looks like roughly speaking, so they can choose a route without leaking to anyone which route they are choosing. 

Liquidity Dynamics
No one can receive a payment over the Lightning Network without someone else choosing to open a Lightning channel to them, and allocate some real bitcoin to that specific route and person. The channel peer must essentially make a bet on that person that they will have people willing to pay them for things regularly, and in enough volume, for that peer to charge fees and earn a satisfactory amount of money. 

This creates a bottleneck, and a need for participants to earn each other’s trust in some way or fashion. People on the network willing to provide this “receiving liquidity” for others need some way to gauge someone’s reputation in terms of coming through and actually providing them an opportunity to earn money. 

This has created the need for what people call “Lightning Service Providers” (LSPs). Service providers who specialize in running infrastructure to target end users and provide them the liquidity needed for them to receive payments. In addition to centralized solutions like this, protocol level solutions like gossip protocol extensions that broadcast offers and fees for opening channels to people with liquidity exist. 

Wrapping Up
Lightning clearly has its limitations, such as barriers to entry created by the need to preallocate funds for a user to receive payments. But in spite of such barriers it has achieved a huge degree of success. 

It hasn’t exactly panned out as a purely self custodial payment solution, but it has definitely been made to work self custodially, even if drudgingly. In addition to that, it has definitively demonstrated its usefulness as a general purpose settlement layer for more industrial scale or centralized uses. 

Lightning is, whether it becomes a fully functioning end user payment system or not, an undeniably effective settlement solution for those who can deal with its complexities. This guarantees it some functionality in the long term Bitcoin ecosystem, regardless of whether it was its intended purpose or not. "

In a newly published report, we provide an overview of the current state of quantum computing, the threat model for Bitcoin, and the next steps being considered. This post offers a summary of our key findings and recommendations. See the full report here.

Timeline for Bitcoin Preparation to Quantum Computing
We outline a dual-track migration strategy for Bitcoin in response to the potential emergence of quantum computing.

Long-Term Path: This comprehensive approach assumes that there is still a substantial window of time before quantum computing poses a practical threat. Drawing on the timelines of prior protocol upgrades such as SegWit and Taproot, we estimate that implementing a full quantum-safe transition could take approximately 7 years.
Short-Term Contingency Path: This track serves as an emergency response in the event of a sudden breakthrough in quantum computing. It prioritizes a rapid deployment of protective measures to secure the Bitcoin network and could be executed in roughly 2 years.
In both scenarios, funds that are carefully managed, i.e., stored in hashed address types like P2PKH or P2WPKH without address reuse, are already protected from quantum attacks. However, spending those funds in a post-quantum secure way would require additional infrastructure, which is expected to be developed during the second phase of either timeline.

Quantum Computers: When Are They Coming, and What Will They Be Capable Of?
If realized at scale, quantum computing could offer significant speed-ups for specific classes of problems by harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics. Of particular concern are cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs), machines capable of breaking the mathematical assumptions underlying modern cryptography. This includes algorithms like Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which is fundamental to Bitcoin’s security. 

While quantum computing has been an active area of theoretical research for decades, significant engineering challenges remain in building large-scale quantum machines, especially CRQCs. To date, no quantum computer has surpassed classical supercomputers in solving commercially relevant problems, nor demonstrated the capabilities needed to threaten modern cryptography.

Estimated timelines for CRQCs
Technological progress is notoriously hard to predict, it rarely follows a linear path, and history offers many examples of sudden breakthroughs. In anticipation of potential shifts in the cryptographic landscape, several organizations have proposed timelines for transitioning cryptographic signatures.

One of the most prominent efforts comes from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which has been leading the development of cryptographic standards. Their published recommendations highlight two key dates:

By 2030, traditional encryption methods, such as ECDSA and RSA, should be phased out.
By 2035, all cryptographic systems should transition fully to post-quantum algorithms.
The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre follows a comparable approach with a three-phase migration framework that aims to complete the transition to post-quantum cryptography by 2035. Other entities, such as the EU and China, are also actively working on post-quantum cryptography strategies, though they have not yet published formal timelines.

 
At the industry level, several leading companies, including Cloudflare, Signal, and Google, have begun adopting post-quantum cryptography. They are implementing hybrid signature schemes that combine traditional encryption methods with post-quantum algorithms, requiring an attacker to break both in order to compromise the system. Apple has also announced plans to transition to post-quantum cryptography. As PQC becomes an emerging industry standard, more companies are expected to follow suit.

What’s at Stake?
The financial stakes of the threat to Bitcoin are substantial. Fig 2 illustrates analysis revealing that approximately ~6.51 million bitcoin, worth over $700 billion at current valuations, and representing 32.7% of current supply, is quantum vulnerable. This includes funds held in addresses that have practiced address reuse, funds secured by inherently quantum-vulnerable script types, and funds that are vulnerable via public key exposure on forks of Bitcoin, such as Bitcoin Cash. 

Bitcoin Threat Model: What Should We Be Worried About?
Quantum computing is expected to impact two key areas of Bitcoin: mining and transaction signatures. In quantum mining, the difficulty of combining the power of multiple machines gives a disproportionate advantage to large quantum miners, threatening decentralization. For transaction signatures, the risk is more direct, a CRQC could derive private keys from public keys, enabling theft of funds. 

Importantly, the timelines for these two threats differ significantly. Building a quantum computer that can outperform modern ASIC miners presents a far greater engineering challenge than constructing one capable of breaking digital signatures. This is due, in part, to the low clock speeds of quantum processors, which are much slower than the highly optimized and specialized hardware used in Bitcoin mining and the lack of parallelization.

Signatures
A CRQC could break the assumption that it is infeasible to derive a private key from its corresponding public key under ECC based schemes, potentially allowing attackers to steal funds. In Bitcoin, ownership of a UTXO is proven by signing a transaction with the private key corresponding to a given public key. If a CRQC can derive that private key from the public key, it can falsely claim ownership and spend the funds.

This leads to two distinct quantum attack scenarios. When spending from hashed addresses, public keys are revealed temporarily, giving attackers a brief window, typically minutes to hours, to derive private keys and steal funds, possibly through chain reorganization. In contrast, certain output types (P2PK, P2MS, P2TR) expose public keys permanently on-chain from the moment funds are received, giving attackers unlimited time to mount quantum attacks. Address reuse converts the temporary vulnerability of hashed addresses into permanent exposure, as public keys remain visible on-chain after the first spend. As shown in Fig 3, the most vulnerable targets are addresses that hold significant funds with exposed public keys such as institutional holdings that practiced address reuse.

Mining
Bitcoin mining is based on the principle that the probability of finding a valid block scales linearly with the amount of computational effort expended. Grover’s algorithm, a quantum search technique, offers a quadratic speedup for brute-force search. However, unlike classical mining, Grover’s algorithm is not easily parallelizable. This limitation could give a disproportionate advantage to entities with access to large-scale, centralized quantum hardware, potentially increasing mining centralization rather than broadening participation.

In addition to concerns about centralization, quantum mining could alter miners’ optimal strategies, potentially degrading chain quality, for example, by increasing the rate of stale blocks. A higher stale block rate can make certain attacks (such as selfish mining or double-spends) less costly and more feasible.

As noted earlier, building a quantum computer capable of outperforming modern ASIC miners is believed to be much farther off than developing CRQCs. As such, quantum mining is not an immediate concern and is unlikely to be a practical threat in the coming decades. Nevertheless, exploring Proof-of-Work mechanisms in a future quantum context remains a worthwhile research direction. Developing a better understanding of the potential risks and mitigation strategies would help the ecosystem prepare for a world where quantum mining becomes feasible.

Migration to Quantum Security: What are the main challenges?
Quantum-Secure Signatures
Quantum-secure cryptographic signatures have been studied for decades, but interest and progress have accelerated in recent years. This has led to the development of candidate protocols such as SPHINCS+, FALCON, and others. However, as a relatively young field, it has seen several proposed schemes initially believed to be secure but were later broken (e.g. SIKE), even by classical computers. While trust in the current candidates is growing over time, the field remains active and evolving.

As detailed in Table 1, a significant limitation of post-quantum signature schemes is their substantially larger key and signature sizes, along with increased verification times, relative to classical algorithms such as ECDSA and Schnorr that are currently used in Bitcoin. To address this, some proposals suggest leveraging SegWit’s witness discount mechanism to reduce on-chain footprint. However, the best approach for integrating quantum-secure signatures into the protocol remains an open question. In addition to performance trade-offs, quantum-secure schemes do not yet support the full range of functionality provided by classical signatures, such as those relied upon in the Lightning Network and other applications. This area continues to be an active focus of research within the cryptography community, and further improvements are expected in the coming years.

Migration Pathways
If the Bitcoin community chooses to migrate vulnerable funds to quantum-resistant formats, a large number of UTXOs will need to be moved. Several approaches are under consideration, each making different tradeoffs. Some focus on enabling secure spending of hashed-address outputs without exposing the public key prematurely. Others propose mechanisms to limit or regulate the spending of UTXOs that are directly vulnerable to quantum theft. These strategies generally require changes to consensus rules, such as soft forks, and must also account for the practical challenge of moving a large volume of UTXOs, potentially taking 4 to 18 months even with sustained allocation of block space. 

Philosophical Dilemma: Do we allow funds to be stolen?
The Bitcoin community faces a fundamental philosophical question: should quantum-vulnerable funds be made permanently unspendable (“burned”) or remain accessible to quantum computers (“stolen”)? This decision touches Bitcoin’s core principles of property rights, censorship resistance, and immutability. The burn approach treats quantum vulnerability as a protocol bug requiring a conservative fix, preventing wealth redistribution to those who win the CRQC race. The steal approach maintains that burning funds violates the property rights of their owners, effectively confiscating assets from those who may simply be unaware of the threat or unable to migrate in time.

The implications extend beyond philosophy to market dynamics. A coordinated burn would permanently remove millions of bitcoins from circulation, potentially increasing the value of remaining coins while providing market certainty. Allowing quantum theft enables massive wealth transfer to entities with quantum capabilities, potentially creating prolonged market uncertainty and volatility as funds are gradually drained. A decision on this matter is a defining moment for Bitcoin’s governance model, requiring the community to balance security imperatives against foundational principles of user sovereignty and non-intervention.

So, what’s next?
The arrival of CRQCs would mark a major shift across the digital landscape, placing much of today’s secure communication, authentication, and digital infrastructure at risk. While quantum computing is not yet a practical reality, preparations are underway to help ensure Bitcoin’s resilience against future developments. Research continues across both the cryptographic and Bitcoin communities to assess potential risks and explore practical responses. Our report highlights two areas that may warrant near-term attention: stopping address reuse and evaluating the trade-offs in the Burn vs. Steal discussion around exposed funds.

The window for proactive action is open now, though it may not remain open indefinitely. Staying informed about advances in quantum computing and cryptography is essential, as is studying potential mitigation strategies and their broader implications for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Ensuring Bitcoin’s long-term security in a post-quantum world requires thoughtful, deliberate work, starting now, so we can make well-informed decisions while time is still on our side."

The healthcare technology company targets holding 10,000 Bitcoin by year end 2025, 42,000 by 2026, and 105,000 by 2027.

The announcement comes as Semler continues expanding its Bitcoin holdings. The company recently acquired 185 Bitcoin between May 23 and June 3 for $20 million, bringing total holdings to 4,449 BTC worth approximately $446.2 million at current prices. 

“We are excited to have Joe join our Bitcoin strategy team and help drive our three-year-plan to own 105,000 Bitcoins,” said Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific. “Joe is an analytical thought leader on Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies. His expertise will be instrumental as we pursue our Bitcoin treasury strategy and aim to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.” 

Since adopting its Bitcoin Standard in May 2024, Semler has “achieved approximately 287% BTC Yield and a $177 million BTC $ Gain through June 3, 2025,” Semler noted. The company currently reports a year-to-date BTC Yield of 26.7%. 

As former director of market research at Unchained, Burnett contributed to helping institutional Bitcoin adoption by providing collaborative custody solutions. He previously served as head analyst at Blockware Solutions, helping launch one of the largest Bitcoin mining platforms in the United States. 

“We are witnessing the global monetization of Bitcoin as a superior form of money,” said Burnett. “The trend to adopt Bitcoin as part of corporate treasury is clearly accelerating. Semler Scientific, as the 2nd U.S. public company to adopt the Bitcoin Standard, has been at the forefront of this movement.” 

Semler’s Bitcoin strategy involves using proceeds from equity and debt financings plus operational cash flows. Since launching its market offering program in April 2025, the company has raised approximately $136.2 million through stock sales.

“Self-custody is at the heart of Bitcoin’s promise,” said the Co-Founder and CTO of Relai Adem Bilican. “As our users continue to accumulate and grow their holdings over time, we recognize the need for long-term solutions designed for serious Bitcoin enthusiasts. Casa is the ideal partner – a sovereignty-focused and user-friendly solution. Together, we’re helping users secure not just their savings, but their legacy.” 

According to the press release, the app has over 500,000 downloads, more than 85,000 active users, and a total user investment exceeding $1 billion. These figures reflect growing user engagement with self-custody Bitcoin solutions intended for long-term use.

Self-custody is a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin ownership, but it also comes with certain risks, particularly around long-term security. The partnership introduces a multisignature (multisig) custody option, which requires multiple keys to access funds. This setup can help mitigate the vulnerabilities of single-key storage.

Through the integration, users who purchase Bitcoin via Relai will have the option to store their assets using Casa’s multisig system. The offering also includes an inheritance feature that allows users to designate a beneficiary, adding a layer of planning for asset transfer across generations.

“Casa’s mission is to maximize sovereignty and security in the world,” stated the CEO of Casa Nick Neuman. “The best way we can do that today is by making sovereign bitcoin custody as safe and simple as possible. Our partnership with Relai will help people stack bitcoin and store it securely, for themselves and their families.”

According to both companies, the integration represents a first-of-its-kind model that combines Bitcoin accumulation with long-term custody and inheritance planning for everyday users."

Designed for freelancers, the platform allows users to send professional invoices without platform fees, identity checks, or third party custody.

According to Deel, a crypto payments company for freelancers, Bitcoin is the most used cryptocurrency in the world for payments. Despite this growth, many freelancers continue to use basic methods such as pasting Bitcoin addresses into PDFs or emails. Some rely on custodial platforms that deduct fees or require identity verification, which can affect both earnings and data privacy.

“We’ve seen too many people paste BTC addresses into documents and call it invoicing,” said the CEO of Flash Pierre Corbin. “It’s messy. It’s risky. And it’s time for something better.” 

Flash Invoicing Features:

0% platform fees: no subscriptions or commission
Non-custodial: Bitcoin goes straight to the user’s wallet
No KYC: users maintain full privacy
Professional output: branded PDFs and secure payment links
Integrated dashboard: manage payments, clients, and revenue
Works with Flash ecosystem: including Stores, Donations, Paywalls, and POS
Many Bitcoin invoicing tools charge a percentage per transaction or require a subscription. As a result, freelancers often lose part of their income simply to issue an invoice and receive payment. Flash is aiming to solve this issue.

“Freelancers work hard enough. The last thing they need is a platform skimming off their earnings,” said Corbin. “That’s why we dropped our fee from 1.5% to 0% — and launched the first invoicing tool that’s truly free, without compromising on privacy or control.”

Flash Invoicing allows users to accept Bitcoin payments without relinquishing control, privacy, or revenue. It is integrated with the broader Flash suite, enabling users to manage invoicing alongside features such as setting up stores, receiving donations, or gating premium content.

“As a freelancer myself, I love using the Flash invoicing feature,” stated a freelancer & Flash user. ”It keeps all my clients in one place, allows me to easily edit invoices and track payments. Much more professional than sending a lightning address in the footer of a PDF invoice.”"

2025-06-13,Bitcoin Layer 2: Statechains - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE4tLVV3M1JyUEJlV1Z1WTN0Ull3eVBpMHJzWWV1ZU9OQnFuWWE4eWxSVTI5U3JFMkxTbHFZVlBGYWdPZWV2U1pkNDBhZ0ZnMFhzVDZNQjU4LTIxLVVvTFVxWVBMcldZWUtCbkFrU0EyM0phRzA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Statechains are an original second layer protocol originally developed by Ruben Somsen in 2018, depending on the eltoo (or LN Symmetry) proposal. In 2021 a variation of the original proposal, Mercury, was built by CommerceBlock. In 2024, a further iteration of the original Mercury scheme was built, Mercury Layer. 

The Statechain protocol is a bit more complicated to discuss compared to other systems such as Ark or Lightning because of the range of variations that are possible between the original proposed design, the two that have been actually implemented, and other possible designs that have been loosely proposed. 

Like Ark, Statechains depend on a centralized coordinating server in order to function. Unlike Ark, they have a slightly different trust model than a vUTXO in an Ark batch. They depend on the coordinating server to delete previously generated shares of a private key in order to remain trustless, but as long as the server follows the defined protocol and does so, they provide a strong security guarantee. 

The general idea of a Statechain is to be able to transfer ownership of an entire UTXO between different users off-chain, facilitated by the coordinator. There is no requirement for receiving liquidity like Lightning, or the coordinator server to provide any liquidity like Ark. 

To begin, we will look at the original protocol proposed by Ruben Somsen. 

The Original Statechain
Statechains are effectively a pre-signed transaction allowing the current owner of the Statechain to unilaterally withdraw on-chain whenever they want, and a history signed messages cryptographically proving that past owners and the receivers they sent the Statechain to approved those transfers. 

The original design was built on eltoo using ANYPREVOUT, but the current plans on how to enable the same functionality make use of CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY and CHECKSIGFROMSTACK (a high level explanation of this is at the end of the CHECKSIGFROMSTACK article). The basic idea is a script enabling a pre-signed transaction to spend any UTXO that has that script and locks the appropriate amount of bitcoin, rather than being tied to spending a single specific UTXO. 

In the protocol, a user wishing to deposit their coins to a Statechain approaches a coordinator server and goes through a deposit protocol. The depositing user, Bob, generates a key that will be uniquely owned by him, but also a second “transitory” key that will eventually be shared (more on this soon). They then craft a deposit transaction locking their coin to a multisig requiring the coordinator’s key and the transitory key to sign. 

Using this multisig, Bob and the coordinator sign a transaction that spends that coin and creates a UTXO that can either be spent by any other transaction signed by the transitory key and the coordinator’s key using LN Symmetry, or Bob’s unique key after a timelock. Bob can now fund the multisig with the appropriate amount, and the Statechain has been created. 

To transfer a Statechain to Charlie, Bob must go through a multistep process. First, Bob signs a message with his unique private key that attests to the fact he is going to transfer the Statechain to Charlie. Charlie must also sign a message attesting to the fact that he has received the Statechain from Bob. Finally, the coordinator server must sign a new transaction allowing Charlie to unilaterally claim the Statechain on-chain before Bob sends Charlie a copy of the transitory key. 

All of this is made atomic using adapter signatures. These are signatures that are modified in such a way using a random piece of data that renders them invalid, but can be made valid again once the holder of the signature receives that piece of information. All of the messages, and the new pre-signed transaction are signed with adapter signatures, and atomically made valid at the same time through the release of the adapter data. 

Holders of a Statechain must trust that the coordinator server never conspires with a previous owner to sign an immediate closure of the Statechain and steal funds from the current owner, but the chain of pre-signed messages can prove that a coordinator has participated in theft if they were to do so. If a past owner attempts to use their pre-signed transaction to steal the funds, the timelock on the spend path using only their key allows the current owner to submit their pre-signed transaction and correctly claim the funds on chain. 

Mercury and Mercury Layer
The original Statechain architecture requires a softfork in order to function. CommerceBlock designed their variant of Statechains to function without a softfork, but in order to do so tradeoffs were made in terms of functionality. 

The basic idea is the same as the original design, all users hold a pre-signed transaction that allows them to claim their funds unilaterally, and the coordinator server still plays a role in facilitating off-chain transfers that requires them to be trusted to behave honestly. The two major differences are how those transactions are signed, and the structure of the pre-signed transaction users are given. 

Where the signing is concerned, there is no longer a transitory private key that is passed from user to user. Instead of this, a multiparty-computation protocol (MPC) is used so that the original owner and the coordinator server are able to collaboratively generate partial pieces of a private key without either of them ever possessing the full key. This key is used to sign the pre-signed transactions. The MPC protocol allows the current owner and coordinator to engage in a second protocol with a third party, the receiver of a transfer, to regenerate different pieces that add up to the same private key. In both the Mercury and Mercury Layer protocol, after completing a transfer an honest coordinator server deletes the key material corresponding to the previous owner. As long as this is done, it is no longer possible for the coordinator to sign a transaction with a previous owner, as the new piece of key material they have is not compatible with the piece any previous owner might still have. This is actually a stronger guarantee, as long as the coordinator is honest, than the original proposal.

The pre-signed transaction structure for Mercury and Mercury Layer can’t use LN Symmetry, as this is not possible without a softfork. In lieu of this, CommerceBlock opted to use decrementing timelocks. The original owner’s pre-signed transaction is timelocked using nLocktime to a time far out in the future from the point of the Statechain’s creation. As each subsequent user receives the Statechain during a transfer, the nLocktime value of their transaction is some pre-determined length of time shorter than the previous owner. This guarantees that a previous owner is incapable of even trying to submit their transaction on-chain before the current owner can, but it also means that eventually at some point the current owner must close their Statechain on-chain before previous owners’ transactions start becoming valid. 

The major difference between Mercury and Mercury Layer is how these transactions are signed. In the case of Mercury, the coordinator server simply sees the transaction proposed, verifies it, and then signs it. Mercury Layer uses a blind-signing protocol, meaning that they do not actually see any details of the transaction they are signing. This necessitates the server tracking Statechains using anonymized records on the server, and a special authorization key of the current owner so that they can be sure they are only signing valid transfers. 

Synergy With Other Layers
Statechains can synergize with other Layer 2s that are based on pre-signed transactions. For instance, part of the original proposal suggested a combination of Statechains and Lightning Channels. Because both are simply pre-signed transactions, it is possible to actually nest a Lightning channel on top of a Statechain. This simply requires the current owner’s unilateral exit key to be a multisig, and the creation of the pre-signed transactions spending that output into a Lightning channel. This allows Lightning channels to be opened and closed entirely off-chain. 

In a similar fashion, it is possible to nest a Statechain on top of a vUTXO in an Ark batch. This simply requires the pre-signed transactions necessary for a Statechain to be constructed, spending the vUTXO output. 

Wrapping Up
Statechains are not entirely trustless, but they are a very trust minimized scheme that is very liquidity efficient and allows freely transferring UTXOs off-chain between any users willing to accept the trust model of Statechains. 

While the original proposal has yet to be built, the two implementations designed by CommerceBlock have been completely implemented. Both failed to achieve anything more than marginal use in the real world. Whether this is due to users being unwilling to accept the trust model involved, or simply a failure in marketing or awareness is something that cannot be fully ascertained. 

Regardless, given that there are two full implementations and designs for a more flexible variation should LN Symmetry ever become possible on Bitcoin, this an option that will always be here. The nice thing about open source software is that it will always be there regardless of whether people use it now, should they choose to in the future."
2025-06-12,The Bitcoin Treasury Strategy That’s Reanimating Zombie Companies - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNcHdka2JNUmFHa0FMcmdzYlFqc0JSSGptSjhEeV9iTEEtc1VFQVVfa3NZWmpUUUZvSTNJTjdqTWc4RnAyUk5wRjdtWHgycERldlR0QnNWTm1mOW03X2N0WTNKeGRrTEN2VDVFQ3FCSElIcW83ZUNHZk8zR2JDclFqcEtKb0JLRHNmMWQ4b1lUT0xrLXRrbmxvc09lZXNpc282TTlOeF91bmpFdFk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A growing number of public companies are stuck in limbo—technically solvent, but strategically stalled. Growth has evaporated. Stock prices have languished. Reinvestment opportunities are unclear or underwhelming. These companies aren’t broken—they’re just drifting.

They’ve become what markets call zombie companies: firms that generate enough to survive, but not enough to excite. And in today’s capital environment, stagnation is no longer neutral—it’s dangerous.

This is where a Bitcoin treasury strategy comes in.

What Is a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy—and What Problem Does It Solve?
At its core, a Bitcoin treasury strategy means converting a portion of idle corporate cash into Bitcoin and treating it as a long-term treasury reserve asset. It’s not a product pivot or a marketing stunt. It’s a capital strategy.

The problem it solves is simple but deadly:

Capital erosion: Fiat currencies are inflating away purchasing power.
Inefficient reserves: Billions in cash sit idle on balance sheets, dragging down return on assets.
Narrative decay: Companies without a growth story get ignored—or punished—by markets.
Shareholder fatigue: Passive capital strategies frustrate conviction-driven investors.
A Bitcoin treasury strategy is designed to reverse that trend—by reframing cash as conviction.

Two Distinct Approaches to a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy
There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to building a Bitcoin treasury. Instead, companies tend to pursue one of two broad strategic paths:

1. Defensive Allocation
Companies like Tesla and Block have allocated a portion of their reserves to Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat debasement. It’s a form of monetary insulation—protecting cash from erosion while signaling awareness of inflation’s long-term effects. These companies aren’t changing their business models, but they are acknowledging that holding cash in today’s environment means silently bleeding purchasing power. This strategy helps improve the hurdle rate, enhances reserve productivity, and sends a forward-looking message to investors.

2. Offensive Accumulation and Securitization
Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), Semler Scientific, and Metaplanet have adopted a more aggressive model. Rather than passively holding Bitcoin, they’ve turned their balance sheets into capital engines—securitizing their Bitcoin holdings through equity and debt issuance to fuel further accumulation. Their goal is to maximize BTC per share, enhance BTC yield, and create shareholder value through financial engineering that compounds exposure. These companies are rewriting the treasury playbook, showing that Bitcoin isn’t just a store of value—it can be a strategic accelerant.

Why Bitcoin—and Not Gold, Equities, or Cash?
Bitcoin isn’t just another asset. It’s engineered monetary policy.

➤ Fixed supply: Bitcoin’s 21 million cap creates built-in scarcity, unlike fiat or equity dilution.

➤ 24/7 liquidity: Global, permissionless markets give companies access to real-time value.

➤ Verifiability and portability: It’s digital capital that can’t be seized, censored, or inflated.

➤ Asymmetric upside: Bitcoin has consistently outperformed every major asset class over multi-year cycles.

More importantly, Bitcoin is narrative fuel. It communicates conviction, discipline, and macro-awareness—all of which modern investors are starving for.

The Components of a Successful Bitcoin Treasury Strategy
A Bitcoin treasury strategy isn’t just about buying Bitcoin. It’s about embedding it into capital structure and governance. That requires rigor.

➤ Treasury governance: Establish internal guardrails on allocation, rebalancing, and reporting.

➤ Secure custody: Choose institutional-grade solutions, with redundancy, auditability, and oversight.

➤ Capital deployment strategy: Some companies use cash. Others leverage equity, debt, or ATM programs.

➤ Market communication: The value of Bitcoin on your balance sheet rises with clarity, transparency, and frequency of investor communication.

Companies like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), Semler Scientific, and Metaplanet didn’t just buy Bitcoin. They built Bitcoin treasury frameworks—with real policies, investor alignment, and governance maturity.

How Bitcoin Reframes the Shareholder Relationship
The Bitcoin treasury model isn’t just a liquidity play. It’s a credibility signal.

➤ Narrative magnet: Bitcoin attracts attention—not just from retail investors, but from global institutions searching for proxy exposure.

➤ Alignment lever: High-conviction shareholders reward companies that act decisively and transparently.

➤ Shareholder base upgrade: Bitcoin introduces long-term, ideologically aligned holders who are less reactive to short-term earnings noise.

Bitcoin gives stale stories new energy. And in capital markets, momentum is everything.

Execution: What It Takes to Make This Strategy Work
Bitcoin is not a set-it-and-forget-it strategy. It requires:

➤ Executive conviction: Most successful strategies are driven by founders, activist chairs, or tightly aligned boards—not committees.

➤ Discipline over hype: Volatility is part of the game. But the strategy must be built to endure it.

➤ Clarity and timing: The best entries are paired with proactive shareholder education and public clarity—not reactive announcements.

The most common failure mode? Buying Bitcoin high, with no treasury framework in place, then being forced to sell low when pressure mounts. That’s not a Bitcoin failure—that’s a structure failure.

Conclusion: You Don’t Need a New Business Model—You Need a Capital One
A Bitcoin treasury strategy isn’t for everyone. But for companies with a strong cash position and weak narrative traction, it offers a clear path forward.

You don’t need to change your product. You don’t need to invent a new category. You need to stop leaking value through capital drift—and start signaling conviction through capital strategy.

In a market where performance is narrative, and capital is credibility, Bitcoin is the benchmark.

Zombie companies won’t survive on inertia. But with a Bitcoin treasury strategy, they might just come back to life."

Privy specializes in helping companies embed Bitcoin and crypto wallets directly into their apps and websites. For example, NFT marketplace OpenSea uses Privy to streamline purchases by automatically generating wallets for users. This removes the need for external wallet setups through services like MetaMask or Coinbase.

“When we started, wallets were powerful but inaccessible for all but the most technical,” said the Co-founder and CEO of Privy Henri Stern in a statement. “Developers had to send users off-platform to get started, breaking flows and killing user conversion. That friction fundamentally constrained what could be built in crypto.”

Privy, based in New York, was founded by Henri Stern and Asta Li in 2021. Li was previously a founding engineer at Aurora, while Stern worked as a research scientist at web3 firm Protocol Labs. The startup has raised just over $40 million from investors including Ribbit Capital, Definition, and Coinbase Ventures, and was last valued at $230 million in March, according to PitchBook.

“We started Privy a little over three years ago to make it easy for any developer to build better products on crypto rails,” stated their announcement. “Whether crypto is core to your app or simply a new layer of functionality, a good crypto product should just feel like a good product, period. By making crypto usable, we help make it useful for everyone.”

The acquisition follows Stripe’s earlier purchase of Bridge which helped accelerate interest in digital assets. Earlier this year, Stripe introduced stablecoin funded accounts designed to help merchants store funds and make international payments using Circle’s USDC and Bridge’s USDB. Similar to Bridge, Privy will continue operating as a standalone product.

Privy will power over 75 million accounts and support more than 1,000 developer teams, enabling billions in transaction volume, according to the announcement. Clients include Hyperliquid, Blackbird, Toku, and Farcaster, all using Bitcoin and crypto infrastructure to build real-world products in areas like trading, payments, payroll, and social applications.

“With a unified platform, connecting Privy’s wallets to the money movement capabilities in Stripe and Bridge, we’re enormously excited to enable a new generation of global, Internet-native financial services,” stated the co-founder and CEO of Stripe Patrick Collison."

(Some Bitcoin and crypto companies are based here, but this has little to do with Adams’ efforts — or lack thereof.)

So, when I heard the mayor propose issuing BitBonds in New York City at Bitcoin 2025, I was far from convinced that this would actually happen.

And then when I read a statement from NYC Comptroller Brad Lander on the topic, it became even more clear to me that Adams was merely posturing when it came to BitBonds.

“New York City will not be issuing any bitcoin-backed bonds on my watch,” said Lander in the statement.

“Mayor Eric Adams may be willing to bet our future on crypto in exchange for a trip to Vegas, but my job is to ensure our City’s financial stability. Cryptocurrencies are not sufficiently stable to finance our City’s infrastructure, affordable housing, or schools,” he added. 

“Proposing that New York City should open its capital planning to crypto could expose our City to new risks and erode bond buyers’ trust in our City.”

In the statement, Lander went on to discuss how BitBonds would work at the federal level (90% of the funds go to government expenditures, while 10% goes to buying bitcoin for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve), before noting a key difference between federal bonds and the bonds that New York City issues.

“While the federal government issues bonds to fund traditional expenditures, New York City primarily issues bonds to fund capital assets and in only very narrow circumstances can the City finance other purposes,” wrote Lander.

Lander then went on to lay out a number of other reasons why New York City will not be issuing BitBonds anytime soon, including that ”New York City would have to be able to take transactions in Bitcoin in order to issue bonds backed by Bitcoin” because “New York City has neither any mechanism to pay for its Capital Assets in any other currency besides the US Dollar nor any means to convert Bitcoin to US Dollars.”

(If I read that correctly, Lander says that New York City doesn’t know how to set up a Bitcoin wallet or trade bitcoin for U.S. dollars. Just about on par for an elected official in New York.)

Now, pardon my cynicism here, but I’m a New Yorker — a resident of one of the most restrictive jurisdictions in the world when it comes to Bitcoin and crypto, thanks to the BitLicense — and there are two things you can bet on at this point in time in New York.

Mayor Eric Adams will talk a good game about Bitcoin and crypto while not taking any action behind the scenes.
Bureaucrats and elected officials alike in New York will continue to throw cold water on anything that challenges Wall Street’s power, while still claiming that New York is the “financial capital of the world.” (Laughable.)
So, Mayor Adams can make all the proposals he wants from stages in Las Vegas to NYC-sponsored crypto summits, but until I see his administration actually do something substantial for New York City residents as it pertains to Bitcoin and crypto, I’ll just assume that New York will continue to stagnate financially."

According to the announcement, the company reported 220.4 BTC in assets and 25.29 BTC in net income for 2024, a 300% year over year increase.

“We’ve just made history as the first company in the world to have Bitcoin-denominated financial statements externally audited,” said Zac Townsend, CEO of Meanwhile. “This is an important, foundational step in reimagining the financial system based on a single, global, decentralized standard outside the control of any one government.” 

The financial statements were audited by Harris & Trotter LLP and its digital asset division ht.digital. Meanwhile’s financials also comply with Bermuda’s Insurance Act 1978, noting that their BTC denominated financials were approved and comply with official guidelines. The firm, fully licensed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA), operates entirely in BTC and is prohibited from liquidating Bitcoin assets except through policyholder claims, positioning it as a long term holder. 

“As the first regulated Bitcoin life insurance company, we view the BTC held by Meanwhile as inherently long-term in nature—primarily held to support the Company’s insurance liabilities over decades,” Townsend added. “This makes it significantly ‘stickier’ and resistant to market pressures compared to the BTC held by other companies as part of their treasury management strategies.” 

Meanwhile’s 2024 financials also revealed 23.02 BTC in net premiums and 4.35 BTC in investment income, showing that its model not only preserves Bitcoin, but earns it. The company’s reserves (also held in BTC) were reviewed and approved by Willis Towers Watson (WTW). 

Meanwhile also offers a Bitcoin Whole Life insurance product that allows policyholders to save, borrow, and build legacy wealth—entirely in BTC, and has plans to expand globally in 2025.

“We are incredibly proud of today’s news as it underscores how Meanwhile is at the forefront of the next phase of the convergence between Bitcoin and institutional financial markets,” said Tia Beckmann, CFO of Meanwhile. “Now having generated net income in BTC, we have demonstrated that we are earning it through a sustainable insurance business model designed for the long term.”"

It is a fundamental limitation of blockchain based systems that they are incapable of facilitating transactional use at a truly global scale without completely sacrificing the decentralization and verifiability that make them valuable in the first place. 

This has been an existential issue that Bitcoiners have grappled with from the very beginning of Bitcoin. This is a comment from James A. Donald, a Canadian cypherpunk who was the first person to reply to Satoshi’s original post on the cryptography mailing list: 

Satoshi Nakamoto wrote:

“The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you
think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes
(ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.
Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or
an average of 100 million transactions per day. That
many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or
the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about
$18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.”

The trouble is, you are comparing with the Bankcard
network.

But a new currency cannot compete directly with an old,
because network effects favor the old.

You have to go where Bankcard does not go.

At present, file sharing works by barter for bits. This,
however requires the double coincidence of wants. People
only upload files they are downloading, and once the
download is complete, stop seeding. So only active
files, files that quite a lot of people want at the same
time, are available.

File sharing requires extremely cheap transactions,
several transactions per second per client, day in and
day out, with monthly transaction costs being very small
per client, so to support file sharing on bitcoins, we
will need a layer of account money on top of the
bitcoins, supporting transactions of a hundred
thousandth the size of the smallest coin, and to support
anonymity, chaumian money on top of the account money.

Let us call a bitcoin bank a bink. The bitcoins stand
in the same relation to account money as gold stood in
the days of the gold standard. The binks, not trusting
each other to be liquid when liquidity is most needed,
settle out any net discrepancies with each other by
moving bit coins around once every hundred thousand
seconds or so, so bitcoins do not change owners that
often, Most transactions cancel out at the account
level. The binks demand bitcoins of each other only
because they don’t want to hold account money for too
long. So a relatively small amount of bitcoins
infrequently transacted can support a somewhat larger
amount of account money frequently transacted.

Despite the era of the Blocksize Wars, the big blockers, and the naive assumptions by many early Bitcoiners that simply raising the blocksize was a viable solution to scale the system, it has been understood by competent observers and engineers from the very beginning that this would undermine the core value proposition of that made it useful in the first place. Hal Finney also spoke of the need for such a settlement layer on top. 

Scaling in layers has always been the only rational plan to make Bitcoin work in the long term, but for a long period of Bitcoin’s early history how to do so without relying on trusted third parties was an elusive problem. 

One of the first ideas on how to do this was sidechains, independent blockchains with a peg to facilitate locking bitcoin on the mainchain to utilize on the sidechain, and at any point unlocking funds on the mainchain to move them back by proving legitimate control of bitcoin on the sidechain. These systems however have yet to achieve a way to operate a peg without either 1) introducing some form of trusted third party, no matter how well mitigated, or 2) creating centralization pressure for the primary Bitcoin network. 

Since those early days there have been many more ideas developed that have found better ways to peg into second layer systems, specifically schemes like the Lightning Network and Ark which allow end users to unilaterally exit back to the mainchain without needing the permission or approval of some operator. 

Scaling Bitcoin in a way that facilitates higher transactional volumes without degrading the security properties of Bitcoin to the point of being indistinguishable from third party operated custodians is one of the most critical problems to solve in order for Bitcoin to truly succeed in the long term. 

This article series will explore the architectures of different Layer 2 systems for Bitcoin, both those deployed live on the network right now and those that are simply design proposals at this point. 

Listed below are the systems I will be covering. The design space of Layer 2s is much more expansive than many people are familiar with, so this list should not be taken as comprehensive and complete, and will be updated over time to reflect additional Layer 2s that are covered.

2025-06-03,Canadian Company SolarBank Adopts Bitcoin Treasury Strategy - Bitcoin Magazine,Bitcoin Magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxPRlVHNzdiQ19oV0JpMXJPelc2SXNrb2RncjdLdlNVVS15XzlnMzNkWEQydkZlM2JvVzhsOXd5MmJ2SldjclRsYzdNS01DOXF2RUlRMWxOYWxPbWplbk5BQXF4eVA4QmtLZjd0THlwbXE4bXd6RGVYcHBEMnZWZXJLbl9NamRDUnR2SVVyc0NqUXZtcy0yNzJz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today, SolarBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN), a leader in distributed solar energy, battery storage, and clean energy infrastructure across North America, has announced the integration of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset into its corporate treasury strategy, following the footsteps of MicroStrategy and SharpLink Gaming.

SolarBank has also applied to open an institutional account with Coinbase Prime (NASDAQ: COIN), enabling secure Bitcoin custody, USDC services, and a self-custodial wallet for its Bitcoin holdings.

The company cited several strategic advantages for adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset:

Financial Resilience: Bitcoin holdings will serve as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement.
Clean Energy Off-set: Emissions tied to Bitcoin mining will be counterbalanced by SolarBank’s renewable energy generation.
Market Appeal: The move targets tech-savvy investors interested in digital assets, DeFi, and blockchain.
Competitive Differentiation: SolarBank aims to differentiate itself as a first-mover in combining renewable energy with Web3 and DeFi principles.
“As the adoption of Bitcoin continues to grow, SolarBank believes that establishing a Bitcoin treasury strategy taps into a growing sector that is seeing increasing adoption,” commented Dr. Richard Lu. “In a world of ever-increasing energy demand and treasury complexity, SolarBank delivers renewable energy solutions and recurring revenues, now combined with all of the benefits of holding Bitcoin.”

SolarBank further emphasized that its core focus remains on renewable energy development, highlighting several recent achievements: 

A $100 million U.S. solar deal with CIM Group targeting 97 MW of projects.
A $49.5 million agreement with Qcells to deploy US made solar technology.
A $41 million partnership with Honeywell to develop landfill-based solar farms. 
A $25 million credit facility from RBC to expand its battery energy storage portfolio.
With over 1 GW of projects in development and partnerships with Fortune 500 companies, SolarBank continues to generate recurring revenues through long-term contracts while accelerating decarbonization efforts.

“The actual timing and value of Bitcoin purchases, under the allocation strategy will be determined by management,” stated the company in the press release. “Purchases will also depend on several factors, including, among others, general market and business conditions, the trading price of Bitcoin and the anticipated cash needs of SolarBank. The allocation strategy may be suspended, discontinued or modified at any time for any reason. As of the date of this press release, no Bitcoin purchases have been made.”"
