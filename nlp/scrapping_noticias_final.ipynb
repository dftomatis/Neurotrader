      "Text: Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has outperformed other asset classes over the past decade, though market commentators highlighted its significantly higher volatility. What Happened: In a post on X on Sep. 1, macro investor Krueger compared the nominal and inflation-adjusted returns of Bitcoin from 2014–2024 to those of the S&P 500, Nasdaq, gold, U.S. real estate, and 10-year Treasury bonds. Using assumptions of 7% \"true\" inflation and a 20% capital gains tax, Bitcoin's 46% real return dwarfed that of its competitors: Nasdaq: +4%, S&P 500: +2%, Gold: +0.5%, U.S. real estate: –1% and 10-year Treasury: –4%. Krueger advised investors to \"pick the right weapon,\" arguing Bitcoin has been the clear winner. Some respondents countered that Ethereum could also make a case as a stronger long-term play, while others noted gold's hedge value remains intact despite its limited upside. Also Read: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin Trade Sideways Ahead Of Labor Market Data What's Next: Prominent professional trader Adam Bakay told Benyinga that while Bitcoin \"has definitely proven itself over the year as a strong macroeconomic asset\" the volatility is higher compared to S&P 500 or Nasdaq. However, he suggests BTC deserves a portfolio allocation, especially given ETF success and rising government interest. Bakay also warned of volatility, as with 40% historical annual swings, investors must prepare for sharp drawdowns. If you can't tolerate a 40% loss, you're overexposed, he advised, recommending Bitcoin be balanced with safer assets such as gold or Treasury bonds. While Bakay acknowledged Bitcoin's strong two-year trend, he expects momentum to slow toward year-end, though uncertainty remains around timing.

      "Text: Publicly traded bitcoin-treasury companies now hold just over 1,000,000 BTC on their balance sheets, a milestone that reflects the rapid institutionalization of corporate bitcoin strategies. Below is a table of the Top 100 Public Bitcoin Treasury Companies from BitcoinTreasuries.net. The top 100 public companies are 479 BTC shy of 1 million BTC. This difference is made up for by public companies that are not in the top 100, bringing total public company holdings to 1,000,632 BTC as of September 4. Enjoying the read? Get our newsletter directly to your inbox on all things Bitcoin-equities by clicking here. The trend of Bitcoin treasuries traces back to Strategy’s (MSTR) initial corporate purchase in August 2020, when the software firm converted cash into bitcoin and set the template for later corporate accumulation programs. Since then, MSTR has outperformed almost all assets. What began as a handful of early adopters expanded through 2024 and into 2025 as a wave of companies began raising capital to increase their allocations. Firms widened their playbooks to include mining revenue, equity raises, and structured financing to grow reserves, driving much of the recent inflows. The list of corporate holders is led by Strategy, which holds nearly two thirds of the total 1 million BTC held by public companies and more than 3% of the 21 million BTC supply. Notably, other public companies have made commitments to purchase large amounts of bitcoin. Semler Scientific (SMLR) aims to hold 105,000 BTC, or 0.5% of the supply, by the end of 2027. Sequans aims to hold 100,000 BTC by 2030. Metaplanet aims to get to 210,000 BTC, or 1% of the supply, by the end of 2027.

      "Text: If you’ve even casually followed investment news, odds are you’ve heard a lot about cryptocurrency. Once a niche interest of the chronically online, crypto has gone mainstream — so much so that even celebrities like Matt Damon and Lionel Messi have endorsed it. For You: How To Start Investing With Less Than $1,000 Find Out: 3 Advanced Investing Moves Experts Use to Minimize Taxes and Help Boost Returns As digital assets gain legitimacy, everyday investors are starting to ask a more practical question: Where does crypto fit into a typical portfolio? You may be one of those curious investors. But with so much conflicting advice, it can be hard to separate hype from helpful guidance. That’s why GOBankingRates turned to Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck and a financial markets expert with over 30 years of experience. As part of our Top 100 Money Experts series, van Eck shared what smart crypto exposure can look like for everyday investors — and why you don’t have to be a “crypto bro” to get involved. One of the most common and apt pieces of investing advice is to diversify your portfolio. According to van Eck, Bitcoin can now be considered a legitimate diversifier, similar to precious metals or real estate — especially as concerns around inflation, currency debasement and geopolitical risk continue to grow. “In our research, even a small allocation of 1 to 3 percent to Bitcoin in a traditional 60/40 portfolio has historically improved risk-adjusted returns,” he said. “The introduction of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. last year has further legitimized these assets, making them easier and safer for investors to access through familiar investment channels.” As a result, he explained, the conversation has shifted from whether crypto is legitimate to how much of it — and what kind — belongs in your portfolio. If you’re looking to diversify with crypto, van Eck also wants you to take the time to learn what differentiates cryptocurrency from other assets — and from each other. “Bitcoin functions more like digital gold, whereas assets such as Ethereum or Solana are more akin to high-growth, innovation-driven technology stocks,” he said. Read Next: Barbara Corcoran: This Is the Only Investment I’ll ‘Never Sell’ One of van Eck’s biggest pieces of advice for new crypto investors is to keep it simple and start with small amounts. “For someone new to crypto, I’d say start with a small allocation to Bitcoin itself,” he shared. “You can buy Bitcoin ETFs in traditional stock trading accounts now. Don’t overthink it or try to trade in and out. Buy a little, spread your purchases out over time, and get comfortable with the asset.”He acknowledges the volatility in crypto and offers tips for how to help manage some of the risk. “The key is to size appropriately: crypto is volatile, so keeping it small ensures it helps your portfolio without overwhelming it. I always tell people to dollar-cost average; don’t try to time it, just add a bit at regular intervals.” Starting slow also means not chasing the newest, flashiest coins or projects you don’t fully understand. “Focus on assets with real network effects and liquidity, namely Bitcoin — and for some, Ethereum or Solana,” he said. If this sounds like a repeat, it’s on purpose: volatility is the price of admission with crypto, and the reason many investors get scared off. Van Eck cautions that while the technology behind digital assets is promising, price swings are likely to remain intense. “Growth assets like crypto can overshoot, as we’ve seen,” he said. “The underlying trend is real, but the path will stay volatile. As an investor, you have to stay disciplined and avoid getting swept up in the hype.” That’s why van Eck recommends strategic moves like dollar-cost averaging your crypto investing. What he doesn’t advise is trying to outsmart the market. “You’re not going to beat the volatility by timing it,” he said. Crypto has evolved from a speculative playground to a serious part of portfolio strategy for everyday investors. It’s one way to diversify your portfolio if you start small, focus on quality assets, and treat crypto like any other long-term investment: with patience, research and a level head.

      "Text: Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) profitability has rebounded from recent lows, but current levels are not strong enough to confirm renewed momentum, according to fresh Glassnode analysis. What Happened: The cryptocurrency is trading near $111,000, consolidating within the $104,000–$116,000 range after heavy absorption by investors. Data shows that short-term holder profitability, which had fallen to just 42% during the selloff, has recovered to around 60%. \"This bounce leaves the market neutral but fragile, with confirmation of renewed momentum only if price reclaims $114k–$116k,” Glassnode noted. The report also highlighted Bitcoin's recent exit from a 3.5-month euphoric phase, as the asset slipped below the 0.95-quantile cost basis. It added that Bitcoin now trades \"between the 0.85 and 0.95 quantile cost basis, or in the $104.1k–$114.3k range,\" a zone that historically corresponds with sideways consolidation. Also Read: Federal Reserve To Host October Conference On Convergence Of Traditional And Decentralized Finance Off-chain indicators suggest weakening demand. Futures funding rates remain neutral but are trending softer, while spot ETF inflows that helped drive earlier rallies have slowed. Inflows that had consistently exceeded 3,000 BTC daily since April have fallen to a 14-day average of just 540 BTC. Ethereum markets showed a similar cooling trend, though Glassnode pointed out structural differences: traditional finance activity in Ethereum included more cash-and-carry arbitrage trades, while Bitcoin demand was primarily directional. What’s Next: The report concluded that while investors have been accumulating in the $108,000–$116,000 range, profitability recovery alone is not yet a decisive signal of strength. \"Reclaiming $114k–$116k would restore broad short-term holder profitability and strengthen the bull case,\" Glassnode said, warning that a breakdown below $104,000 could lead to a move toward $93,000–$95,000.

What's Driving the Change During the interview, Daye explained a trend that's quietly reshaping corporate America: companies are moving beyond just tracking earnings per share to measuring \"Bitcoin per share\" and digital asset returns. It's a shift that reflects how businesses are rethinking their entire approach to treasury management and capital allocation. \"We're seeing companies realize that holding digital assets isn't just about speculation—it's about building financial infrastructure for the future,\" Daye said. \"Our job at MFH is to make that transition practical and compliant.\" MFH is responding to this demand with solutions across high-growth areas that Daye identified as major market opportunities: Digital Asset Treasury Strategy: MFH not only launched our own digital asset treasury strategy with a focus on Solana and Bitcoin as core ecosystems, but also served as a strategic digital asset advisor to guide clients’ treasury initiatives.

(Nasdaq: KIDZ) to design and implement a Solana-focused treasury strategy, reinforcing MFH’s role in bridging institutional finance with blockchain-native ecosystems.Together, these initiatives highlight MFH’s leadership in delivering digital asset treasury solutions designed to comply with applicable regulations and expanding access between blockchain innovation and traditional capital markets.

      "Text: The cryptocurrency market has been giving up gains over the past two weeks, with Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a seven-week low in late August. The cryptocurrency recovered from falling as low as $107,000 after hitting an all-time high in July. Since then, Bitcoin has remained rangebound between $110,000 and $112,000 and has occasionally risen above $115,000. There are several factors behind the ongoing volatility as investors remain concerned about the economy’s health. However, once investors get more clarity on the economy’s position, the cryptocurrency is expected to resume its rally. Investors should thus make the most of this opportunity and take the buy-the-dip approach and invest in crypto-centric stocks. We have selected four stocks: PayPal Holdings PYPL, Interactive Brokers Group IBKR, Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA. Each of these stocks has strong growth potential for 2025 and has seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the past 60 days. Bitcoin was trading around $110,492 on Wednesday night after falling to nearly $107,000 earlier in the week. The cryptocurrency has hit four all-time highs this year, with the last being $124.496 in July. Bitcoin has declined nearly 15% over the past month, occasionally paring some of the losses, but remains sharply lower than its all-time high. Several factors have raised concerns in the minds of investors, who are skeptical about making investments in risky assets. Although the unemployment rate is still very low, a weak jobs report has raised concerns over a struggling labor market. Also, investors are yet to understand the real impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The new set of tariffs has already been pushing prices of goods higher, igniting fears of inflation climbing back again. This saw consumer confidence declining to 97.4 in August from 98.7 in July, a 1.3% drop. However, the ongoing decline is temporary. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are likely to get a boost in the coming days once the Federal Reserve starts easing its monetary policy. The Fed has hinted at a possible rate cut in September, which bodes well for growth-oriented assets, including cryptocurrencies. Markets are now pricing in a 97.6% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut in September, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool. PayPal Holdings provides digital wallet services that enable users to purchase, transfer and sell various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Through PYPL, cryptocurrencies can be used to pay for goods and services from online merchants. Additionally, PayPal’s mobile wallet platform, Venmo, allows users to engage in cryptocurrency buying and selling activities.PayPal Holdings’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 12.3%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.8% over the last 60 days.

As a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.

      "Text: Bitcoin (BTC) is lower than it was 24 hours ago, down about 0.7%, but still firmly within the range that's constrained it since the last week of August. The decline's become a little more pronounced since midnight UTC, with a drop of about 0.9%. For the broader market, the CoinDesk 20 Index has fallen 1.3% since midnight, with all but one component heading south. XRP (XRP) is the only token in the green, and that's up less than 0.1%. The negative sentiment is echoed in the options and perpetual futures markets. Perpetual funding rates have dropped and put options, or protection against price declines, dominating over calls. More than $4.5 billion in options is set to expire on Deribit on Friday, alongside the U.S. jobs report for August. \"Open interest is tilted toward puts, with notable clustering around the $105,000 to $110,000 strikes, suggesting downside protection remains a key theme,\" the derivatives exchange said in a post on X. BTC derivatives positioning has cooled, activity is still there however, with momentum and directional conviction looking muted rather than stagnant. Open interest in perpetual futures across major venues has dropped from the recent peak near $33 billion to about $30 billion. At the same time, the three-month annualized basis keeps compressing to roughly 5%–6% across Binance, OKX and Deribit, leaving the carry trade only marginally profitable. Options data is sending mixed signals. While the upward-sloping implied volatility curve suggests the market expects long-term volatility to be higher than short-term, other metrics point to a more immediate bearish outlook. Specifically, the 25 delta skew continues to be either flat or slightly negative, with traders paying a premium for puts over calls to gain downside protection. This short-term bearish sentiment is contradicted by 24-hour put call volume, with calls (63%) dominating options contracts for BTC. Funding rate APRs across major perpetual swap venues are little changed around 4%-6% annualized, according to Velo data. Hyperliquid is the only exchange with a rate higher than 6% for BTC, reflecting a pocket of stronger long-term interest relative to other exchanges. Overall, funding dynamics suggest a stable market with isolated signs of froth, rather than broad directional conviction. Coinglass data shows $225 million in 24-hour liquidations, with a 50-50 split between longs and shorts. ETH ($65million), BTC ($46 million) and others ($19 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. The Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $110,250 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of a price drop.By Oliver Knight Donald Trump-linked DeFi token word liberty financial (WLFI) slumped to a record low $0.174 on Thursday as the token's popularity begins to fade just days after its trading debut. The 21% daily drawdown can be attributed to a number of factors, notably the fact that some token holders are still in profit after purchasing during the token sale. These holders will be tempted to lock in their profits as hype around the project fades. One trader made $250 million after buying $15 million during the sale, another lost $2.2 million after going long on WLFI futures. While WLFI is linked to the U.S. president, in terms of development and innovation, there's nothing obvious to differentiate it from the thousands of other DeFi-themed tokens. As a result traders may be inclined to jump ship until they see development of the project. \"WLFI team, stop sleeping and start taking action. The community is already angry, at least don’t lose the last remaining investors,\" one holder wrote on X. The chart looks eerily similar to the TRUMP memecoin that was released in January. After a period of initial upside, TRUMP lost 89% of its value and daily volume dwindled from $39 billion on opening day to just $210 million in the past 24 hours. In an attempt to quell the selling pressure, the project revealed on X that WLFI held by the team would not be sold on the open market, stating that every token in the treasury would be subject to governance and not the team's discretion. The tweet failed to stem the decline, and prices continued to tumble shortly after. Saksham Diwan contributed to this report.\n",

      "Text: Markets are preparing for pivotal U.S. labor market data, with jobless claims due Thursday and the non-farm payrolls report scheduled for Friday. Analysts say the figures will provide critical input for Federal Reserve policymakers, who are balancing persistent inflation pressures against signs of cooling employment. The Fed's mandate requires it to pursue both stable prices and maximum employment. At the central bank's annual Jackson Hole symposium in August, Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the growing tension between those objectives, noting that \"the risks to the employment side of our mandate have increased.\" Labor market data has played a decisive role in shaping policy expectations throughout 2025. When unemployment edged up to 4.1% earlier this summer, Treasury yields fell and risk assets rallied on speculation the Fed would adopt a more cautious stance. Conversely, stronger-than-expected reports earlier in the year temporarily revived expectations of tighter monetary policy, sending yields higher and weighing on equities and digital assets. Speaking with Benzinga, Kanny Lee, CEO of SecondSwap, underlined the global reach of this week's numbers. \"This week's jobs report may be domestic, but it shapes expectations for liquidity globally, and crypto markets often react more sharply to those shifts than other assets,\" he said. Also Read: Tom Lee: Ethereum Could Reach $62,000 If It Hits This ETH/BTC Ratio John Murillo, Chief Business Officer at fintech solutions provider B2BROKER, described the labor market as being in \"a curious balance,\" with steady unemployment but weaker job creation. \"A disappointing jobs report could reinforce the Fed's more cautious stance, driving yields down and giving a boost to riskier assets,\" Murillo explained. \"On the flip side, if job growth surprises on the upside, it could complicate the Fed's decision-making and reignite hawkish sentiments.\" Alexis Sirkia, Captain of Yellow Network, said the market's heightened sensitivity to one report reflects deeper structural issues. \"This week's job numbers might be a big deal for markets. If the report is strong, it could mean the Fed keeps interest rates high, which might be bad for stocks/crypto. If it’s weak, people might hope the Fed will cut rates, which could make stocks/crypto go up,\" he said. He argued the volatility underscores the need for a financial system \"that is more trustable and doesn't rely on single centralized entities emitting politicized opinions.\"The releases come as global investors also parse purchasing managers' indexes (PMIs) and other leading indicators, setting up a week of cross-asset moves closely tied to U.S. economic resilience.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency was trading at $111,000 early in the day, down 0.4% over the past 24 hours.

      "Text: By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) September has started much like August ended, with low volumes, subdued volatility, and most of the market-moving headlines coming from traditional finance. Gold rose to $3,560 before easing back, while government bond yields globally retreated from recent highs. Bitcoin perpetual funding rates, payments designed to keep perpetual futures contracts close to the spot price, have cooled and are now around 6% after hitting double-digit levels earlier. Open interest, meantime, continues to drop, with just over 720,000 contracts outstanding, denominated in BTC. As for publicly listed bitcoin treasury companies, their multiples to net asset value (mNAV) are also extending declines. Strategy (MSTR) now trades at an mNAV of just over 1.55 and Metaplanet (3350) sits at 1.71 after a 7% share-priced ecline in Japan trading. KindlyMD (NAKA) dropped a further 9% on Wednesday, leaving it down 75% from its all-time high, and now trades at an mNAV of 2.5. More than $4.5 billion in crypto options are set to expire on Deribit, on Friday, which is also the day of the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. For bitcoin, $3.28 billion in notional value is due, with a max pain point at $112,000 and a put-call ratio of 1.38. \"Open interest is tilted toward puts, with notable clustering around the $105,000 to $110,000 strikes, suggesting downside protection remains a key theme,\" the derivatives exchange said in a post on X. Ether options account for $1.27 billion in notional value, with a put-call ratio of 0.78 and a max pain level of $4,400. Deribit notes \"flows are more balanced, but calls are building above $4,500, signaling growing interest in upside optionality\". Stay alert!

The 21% daily drawdown can be attributed to a number of factors, notably the fact that some token holders are still in profit after purchasing during the token sale. These holders will be tempted to lock in their profits as hype around the project fades. One trader made $250 million after buying $15 million during the sale, another lost $2.2 million after going long on WLFI futures. While WLFI is linked to the U.S. president, in terms of development and innovation, there's nothing obvious to differentiate it from the thousands of other DeFi-themed tokens. As a result traders may be inclined to jump ship until they see development of the project. \"WLFI team, stop sleeping and start taking action. The community is already angry, at least don’t lose the last remaining investors,\" one holder wrote on X. The chart looks eerily similar to the TRUMP memecoin that was released in January. After a period of initial upside, TRUMP lost 89% of its value and daily volume dwindled from $39 billion on opening day to just $210 million in the past 24 hours. In an attempt to quell the selling pressure, the project revealed on X that WLFI held by the team would not be sold on the open market, stating that every token in the treasury would be subject to governance and not the team's discretion. The tweet failed to stem the decline, and prices continued to tumble shortly after. BTC derivatives positioning has cooled, activity is still there however, with momentum and directional conviction looking muted rather than stagnant. Open interest in perpetual futures across major venues has dropped from the recent peak near $33 billion to about $30 billion. At the same time, the three-month annualized basis keeps compressing to roughly 5%–6% across Binance, OKX and Deribit, leaving the carry trade only marginally profitable. Options data is sending mixed signals. While the upward-sloping implied volatility curve suggests the market expects long-term volatility to be higher than short-term, other metrics point to a more immediate bearish outlook. Specifically, the 25 delta skew continues to be either flat or slightly negative, with traders paying a premium for puts over calls to gain downside protection. This short-term bearish sentiment is contradicted by 24-hour put call volume, with calls (63%) dominating options contracts for BTC. Funding rate APRs across major perpetual swap venues are little changed around 4%-6% annualized, according to Velo data. Hyperliquid is the only exchange with a rate higher than 6% for BTC, reflecting a pocket of stronger long-term interest relative to other exchanges. Overall, funding dynamics suggest a stable market with isolated signs of froth, rather than broad directional conviction. Coinglass data shows $225 million in 24-hour liquidations, with a 50-50 split between longs and shorts. ETH ($65million), BTC ($46 million) and others ($19 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. The Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $110,250 as a core liquidation level to monitor, in case of a price drop.

BTC vs gold market cap: 8.77% Altcoin dominance (excluding the top 10) has rebounded from a bottom just under 6% and is now testing key resistance near 8%.

If this relationship persists, the model points to a potential BTC bottom around Sept. 11, followed by a resumption of the rally.

      "Text: The crypto market is down today, and the majority of the top 100 coins have turned red over the past 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 0.2%, now standing at $3.91 trillion. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $124 billion. TLDR: The crypto market saw a minor decrease; About 70 of the top 100 coins have turned red today; 4 of the top 10 coins have appreciated today, with ETH at the top; BTC is down 0.3% to $110,467, and ETH rose 1.5% to $4,369; ’Market participants are cautiously strengthening their positions in ETH by selling BTC’; World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has continued its post-launch plunge; ’The future isn’t a Bitcoin vs Ethereum binary’; US BTC spot ETFs recorded inflows of $301.32 million, while US ETH ETFs saw outflows of $38.24 million; Crypto sentiment exits the fear zone, but caution still reigns. At the time of writing, four of the top 10 coins per market capitalization have increased over the past 24 hours, and four are down (not taking stablecoins into account). Bitcoin (BTC) fell 0.3% at the time of writing, now trading at $110,467. This is the smallest drop on this list. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is up 1.5%, now changing hands at $4,369. This is the highest increase in this category. The second-biggest rise in the category is Tron (TRX)’s 0.4%, now standing at $0.3382. Solana (SOL)’s 0.9% is the highest drop among the ten coins. It’s now trading at $206. As for the top 100 coins, MemeCore (M) is up the most, with a 26.8% increase to the price of $1.08. Pump.fun (PUMP) follows with 13% to $0.004231. The rest are up below 9% each. On the other hand, World Liberty Financial (WLFI) continues dropping and stays at the top of the red list. It’s now down an additional 19.6% to $0.181. It’s also the only coin with a double-digit drop. POL (POL) is next, as it fell 4% to the price of $0.2732. Meanwhile, Treasury, Europe’s first Bitcoin treasury company on a primary stock exchange, backed by the Winklevoss twins, has raised $147 million. “It is time to start Europe’s Digital Golden Age,” founder and CEO Khing Oei wrote.. Alexei Zamyatin, co-founder of BOB, commented that August saw $4.37 billion in institutional flows. Institutions already hold over 7% of the total BTV supply, which is more than $164 billion in total. “The first phase of adoption was about onboarding institutions into digital assets. The next phase will mirror institutional TradFi: putting those assets to work through yield-generating DeFi applications,” Zamyatin said.He continues: “Ethereum has long been the spiritual home of DeFi, with proven apps and a thriving developer base. But as institutions deploy capital into protocols, they won’t just look for innovation, they’ll demand security. And the largest security budget in crypto doesn’t belong to Ethereum, it belongs to Bitcoin. The future isn’t a Bitcoin vs Ethereum binary. It lies at their intersection: ETH liquidity plus BTC security unlocking the next wave of institutional DeFi.” Moreover, Sergei Gorev, Head of Risk at YouHodler, the season of profit redistribution among crypto holders continues on crypto platforms. In the last few weeks, there have been significant inflows into second-tier coins, as well as local outflows of liquidity from BTC. “Market participants are cautiously strengthening their positions in ETH by selling BTC. There is also a noticeable increase in the positive dynamics in capital flows to SOL.” That said, with the beginning of the autumn business season, the price of BTC may straighten again, Gorev said. “In our opinion, the strengthening of the position of second-tier coins is quite long-term,” Gorev argued. “Firstly, this is due to the market redistribution of profits of early investors in BTC, and secondly, in the future, the creation of crypto reserves may occur in the most liquid crypto projects, which can attract a wide range of corporate investors willing to invest billions of dollars. We think the next interesting market ideas could be SOL and XRP.” At the time of writing on Thursday morning, BTC trades at $110,467. The coin initially surged to $112,502, but has failed to hold that level. It has then plunged again to the current level, which is the day’s lowest point. BTC is down 2.1% in a week and 3.5% in a month. It’s still green within a year, with an increase of 95.8%. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently trading at $4,369. It saw an increase from the intraday low of $4,305 to the intraday high of $4,486. It has since decreased to the current level, but it’s still green over the 24 hours. While it’s down 4% in a week, it’s up 19% in a month and 85% in a year. Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment has continued increasing within the neutral zone. The crypto fear and greed index climbed from 42 yesterday to 44 today. Investors are highly cautious and are awaiting further signals to see which direction the market will turn. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded another day of inflows of $301.32 million – similar level to the day prior. Four ETFs saw positive flows, and one recorded outflows. BlackRock leads the list with $289.84 million, followed by Grayscale’s $28.83 million. On the other hand, Ark&21Shares saw outflows of $27.9 million. Source: SoSoValue On the other hand, the US ETH ETFs saw another day of outflows on Wednesday, with $38.24 million. Three of the nine funds saw positive flows, but one fund’s outflows erased those gains. The highest inflow is Fidelity’s $65.78 million, and the one outflow is Grayscale’s $151.39 million. Source: SoSoValue Meanwhile, U.S. Bancorp, the fifth-largest commercial bank in the US, relaunched its institutional Bitcoin custody service after three years, following regulatory clarity and rising demand from investors. The service will initially cover BTC for registered investment funds and spot Bitcoin ETF providers, with plans to expand if conditions allow. Moreover, the largest Ethereum corporate holder, Bitmine, acquired an additional 80,325 ETH on Thursday, valued at $358 million from Galaxy Digital and FalconX, as part of its Ethereum Strategy. Bitmine now holds a total of 1,947,299 ETH, valued at $8.69 billion. Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market decreased over the past day, while the stocks went up. By the closing time on Wednesday, the S&P 500 was up by 0.51% and the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.79%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.054%. Investors are digesting a slew of reports this week and are preparing for the August jobs report, set to be released this Friday. Is this dip sustainable? The market is likely to continue with minor drops and increases in the near term. In the mid-term, analysts expect further increases.

      "Text: The milestone underscores ACA’s leadership in supporting first-to-market innovation across U.S. ETF markets NEW YORK, September 04, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ACA Group (ACA), a leading governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) advisor in financial services, today announced that its ACA Foreside division has surpassed $500 billion in exchange-traded fund (ETF) assets serviced. Known for its client-focused, hands-on approach, ACA Foreside, ACA’s distribution division, continues to support some of the industry’s most innovative product launches, including first-to-market structures such as leveraged ETFs, mutual fund-to-ETF conversions, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs), and digital and crypto ETFs. ACA Foreside services more than 95% of the ETF industry when the distributor role is outsourced, supporting a diverse mix of global asset managers, boutique investment firms, white-label platforms, and series trust sponsors. This reach reflects not just scale, but specialization, offering tailored distribution and compliance solutions that preserve brand identity and enable product differentiation. \"Surpassing $500 billion in ETF assets serviced reflects both the trust our clients place in ACA and the depth of our experience in supporting issuers from launch,\" said Patrick Olson, CEO of ACA Group. \"Our work extends well beyond distribution.

      "Text: Retail investors appear to have limited appetite for high-risk meme coins right now. Interest rate cuts could potentially lead to increased risk-taking in the markets. Concerns around the economy weighed down Dogecoin this year, and that could continue to be a factor in its future. 10 stocks we like better than Dogecoin › It hasn't been a bad year for crypto as a whole. Bitcoin has hit record highs, and President Donald Trump has been putting into place crypto-friendly legislation, including the creation of a regulatory framework for stablecoins. But Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), which initially rallied after his election win last November, has been in a tailspin this year. Since January, it has declined by more than 30%, while Bitcoin is up around 18% and the S&P 500 has risen by about 9%. The meme coin has been falling out of favor with crypto investors of late, but it's still the eighth largest coin, with a market cap of $32 billion as of Sept. 2. Is now a good time to load up on one of the most popular meme coins in the market? Dogecoin is a speculative meme coin, and how it performs is going to hinge on the appetite retail investors have for risk. Right now, that hunger doesn't appear to be significant. Bitcoin is the safest and most popular cryptocurrency, and it has been rising in value this year. But riskier options, including Dogecoin and rival Shiba Inu, which is down more than 40%, have been going in the reverse direction. The key to turning fortunes around for meme coins could depend on what happens with interest rates. If they come down, that decreases borrowing costs for companies and is a sign that inflation is perhaps at more acceptable levels -- and that may result in a greater acceptance of risk in the markets. The good news for crypto investors is that according to the CME FedWatch tool, there is near 92% probability that rates will be cut this month. And there's nearly a 50% probability that there will be another cut in October. If multiple rate cuts happen, that could be the catalyst necessary to give Dogecoin and other meme coins a boost this year. However, that doesn't mean that it will be smooth sailing for Dogecoin. Interest rate cuts could be a good thing for Dogecoin, but in the bigger picture, tariffs and the overall strength of the economy may be more important factors to consider. The meme coin hit its lows for the year back in April, around the time reciprocal tariffs were announced.How the economy does and how bullish investors are about the market as a whole may be more of a factor in how Dogecoin performs than whether the Fed cuts rates at its next meeting. If there are fears of a recession coming or an economic slowdown, that may result in investors being more careful with their money. And Bitcoin and stablecoins may offer more safety for crypto buyers and be more attractive than meme coins like Dogecoin. Investing in cryptocurrency is risky and speculative as it is, but buying meme coins takes it to another level entirely. More crypto-friendly policies could reveal safer investment opportunities for crypto investors outside of meme coins. And by having a wider pool of investments to choose from, buying Dogecoin may not be all that appealing anymore. With limited practical uses for the digital token and a high degree of risk involved with owning it, there isn't an overwhelming reason to buy it today, even though it is trading at a reduced value. And even with its recent decline, it has still more than doubled in value over the past 12 months. Dogecoin is by no means a bargain, and it's full of risk. For the vast majority of investors, the best option is to simply steer clear of it. Before you buy stock in Dogecoin, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dogecoin wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

      "Text: When BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) options went live on Nov. 19, trading activity exploded, reaching over $2 billion in volume on day one. Around the same time, Strategy’s (MSTR) multiple to net asset value (mNAV), calculated by dividing its enterprise value by its bitcoin (BTC) NAV, hit a cycle peak of 3.141 on Nov 20. This peak aligned with bitcoin’s price nearing $100,000 and MSTR’s stock reaching an all-time high of $540. Since then, MSTR has fallen 40%, and its mNAV has compressed to 1.55. At the peak, Strategy held 331,200 BTC, which now represents an increase of roughly 305,000 BTC compared to earlier holdings. MSTR has long offered investors a unique trading vehicle, blending equity exposure with bitcoin’s volatility. Traders could use it both as a leveraged play on bitcoin and as an instrument for options strategies. This differentiated it from IBIT, which only provided direct exposure to spot bitcoin, but now investors have the choice of both. Despite IBIT’s strong debut and steady growth, MSTR has massively outperformed since the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. MSTR is up more than 515%, compared to IBIT’s 128% gain. On metrics like historical trading volume and volatility, MSTR continues to outpace IBIT. Currently, bitcoin implied volatility sits below 40, a relatively subdued level. Implied volatility reflects the market’s expectations of future price swings, and when it is low, traders are less inclined to pursue leveraged or option-based strategies. For leverage products like MSTR to regain momentum, bitcoin volatility will likely need to climb higher.\n",
